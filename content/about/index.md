**Hi, I'm Tom.**

This site's domain name is short for _teitantom_, an alias I've been using for video games, Steam, PSN etc. for as long as I can remember.

I grew up with the internet, doing my first websites more than 15 years ago when _Times New Roman_, `marquee` tags and frames were still state of the art and my HTML was hacked into Notepad or Proton predominantly. I was lucky enough to be taught C, some JavaScript and Pascal in school for some years too - I'm sure I didn't appreciate that as much back then as I do now, but it certainly provided a solid foundation.
