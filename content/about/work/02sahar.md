# Coding a website for Sahar Heumesser, a freelance graphic designer.

Creating a personal website for Sahar Heumesser, a freelance graphic designer.

### Tools

For this project, the following tools/frameworks/services were used:

- hugo
- Tailwind CSS
- fuse.js
- gulp
- Netlify
- forestry.io

### Summary

I had (still having) a blast working with Tailwind - once you've gotten used to it, it's incredibly fast and super flexible.

Refusing to use jQuery here, let's see for how long it'll stay that way.

<s>Aside from that, this site is still a work in progress, features/sections (blog, portfolio,...) are going to be added to it gradually over time.</s>

The blog, a portfolio section and the services page were added in summer 2019.

Notable enhancements as of Oct. 2019:

- content management via [forestry.io](https://forestry.io)
- "static search" based on a JSON index and fuse.js
- "static comments" based on [this blog post](https://ttntm.me/blog/static-blog-comments-hugo/)
