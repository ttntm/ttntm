# Coding a website for Natalia Garcez, a freelance graphic designer.

Creating a personal website for Natalia Garcez, a freelance graphic designer.

Central requirement was independent (self-service) content maintenance and flexible pages built from pre-defined building blocks.

### Tools

In order to create a fast and responsive static website aligned with the design guidelines, the following tools/frameworks/services were used:

- hugo
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- gulp
- Netlify

### Summary

The design was clearly defined by the client and got implemented based on a customized Bootstrap 4 grid. There's a bunch of little details, smooth transitions and _CSS tricks_ in there, which was a good exercise during the implementation phase.

The cases/portfolio items were implemented as a modular building block system, making sure that each case can have an individual page structure instead of following a global template.

On top of that, a multiselect filter on the portfolio overview page provides easy access to the portfolio items.

The result is a fast, responsive modern website, focused on the author's relative independence when it comes to presenting her work.
