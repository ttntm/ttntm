# Coding a website for Alpengummi, the first all natural chewing gum from Austria.

Alpengummi upgraded to a fast, modern and static website incl. CMS functionality.

A major requirement was a self-service content management, which is why forestry.io was used.

### Tools

In order to create a fast and responsive static website with powerful CMS functionality, the following tools/frameworks/services were used:

- hugo
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- gulp
- Netlify
- forestry.io

### Summary

Alpengummi decided to move their website away from Wordpress, making use of a modern, fast and responsive static website. The necessary CMS functionality was implemented using forestry.io, a service capable of providing a content management layer for static sites like the ones created by hugo.

A key feature of the website is the shop finder, a large (dynamic) JSON-based list of online and offline retailers stocking the chewing gum.

Other features include a Blog, Mailchimp integration, FAQs and the possibility of posting job offers in the future.

The website was designed by {{< link-ext "Natalia Garcez" "nataliagarcez.com" >}} based on Bootstrap 4.
