Had some issues working with 2 different accounts at GitHub recently.

Initial `git clone` with the desired identity (specified explicitly) sets up the repository correctly:

{{< highlight bash >}}
git clone -c core.sshCommand="/usr/bin/ssh -i /home/me/.ssh/id_rsa_foo" git@github.com:me/repo.git
{{< /highlight >}}

GIT `config` should then contain this automatically:

{{< highlight bash >}}
[core]
  ...
  sshcommand = /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/me/.ssh/id_rsa_foo
{{< /highlight >}}
