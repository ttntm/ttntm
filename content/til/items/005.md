I recently got the Android 10 update and had to factory reset my phone thanks to the phone's language settings not sticking anymore. Factory reset unearthed all the bloatware again that I had gotten rid of years ago, so I also had to do that again.

Here's a quick reminder of how to do that:

1. Get ADB platform tools for your OS
2. On your phone: enable developer mode and USB debudding
3. Connect phone
4. Test if connected successfully and allow debugging (will be prompted): `adb devices`
5. `adb shell` to get into the phone
6. List packages with `pm list packages | grep 'pkg.name.etc'` or search for them like this: `pm list packages -f TESTPKG`
7. Uninstall bloatware like this: `pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.google.youtube`
8. See bloatware disappear üòÅ
