title: 'Vue3: handle page refresh (F5) in your application'

I recently noticed that there was an issue with cross device data in WATCH3R. Adding/removing list items on one device would not update the app's (cached) state on another device. Logging out and back in would resolve this issue, but refreshing the page wouldn't.

After a bit of research, I found out that there wasn't really a "best practice" on how to handle page refresh in Vue, so I simply tried some things that seemed promising.

What I ended up with is the following:

{{< highlight js >}}
const updateList = () => {
  if (mode.value) { // double check 'mode' here, just in case
    store.dispatch('list/readList', mode.value);
  }
}

onMounted(() => {
  setTimeout(updateList, 250) // timeout is required here; otherwise 'route.meta.mode' is undefined
})
{{< /highlight >}}

I placed this code directly in `App.vue`, which is the entrypoint of my application and gets re-loaded on page refresh. `route.meta.mode` controls which list's data to load - I decided against re-loading all list data, as that wouldn't be in line with the app's caching strategy.
