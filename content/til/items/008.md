Cost me more time than I anticipated, esp. due to the fact that _it only happened for production builds_.

So, in order for a `<select>` (with an Object-based `v-model`) to properly display its default value in Vue 3 (3.0.2), this had to be done:

{{< highlight html >}}

<select ... v-model.lazy="selected" @change="update(selected)">
  <option disabled :value="{}" :selected="selected === {}">Select Something...</option>
  <option v-for="(item, index) in list" :key="index" :value="item">{{ item.title }}</option>
</select>

{{< /highlight >}}

The `:selected="selected === {}"` was necessary, as the `<select>` would otherwise display as a blank box once the `v-for` rendered `<option>` elements came in.

Again, this only happened in _production_, local dev builds _did not_ behave that way which made it extremely frustrating to debug.

Probably worthy of further investigation and a report to the Vue team, but I don't have time to try and get a reproducible example done at the moment.
