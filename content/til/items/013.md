title: "Get mobile browsers to display the correct Favicon"

Mobile browsers were driving me crazy for a while - they kept choosing the one icon with a solid background (that apple touch thing) over all the other icons.

Looks like the issue was caused by the fact that the lazily copy/pasted code from a very well known Favicon generator did not account for the larger icons in the `<head>`. When I added the bigger icons there, mobile Chromium-based browsers started correctly displaying the desired icon.

For future reference:

{{< highlight html >}}
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#012B48">

<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="512x512" href="/android-chrome-512x512.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="192x192" href="/android-chrome-192x192.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicon-16x16.png">

<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-180x180-solid.png">
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#5bbad5">

<meta name="masapplication-config" content="/browserconfig.xml">
{{< /highlight >}}

Other findings during the process of researching Favicon details:

- keep `favicon.ico` in the site root, no need to reference it in the `<head>`
- unless "Add to Homescreen" is used, the icons in `site.webmanifest` don't seem to matter
- mobile browser icon caching is wonky, always test on multiple devices and/or with freshly installed browsers
