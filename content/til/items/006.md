title: "Hugo: RSS feed duplication"

Checking Google Search Console earlier this week made me notice that Hugo created duplicates of my RSS feed in strange places like `/tags/feed.xml` `/tags/tagname/feed.xml`.

After a quick look at the {{< link-ext "Hugo documentation" "gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/#default-output-formats" >}}, I found out that this behaviour seems to be the default for pages of the kind `taxonomy` and `term` - seems I forgot about that or never even noticed it in the first place...

**Conclusion**: I had to change the `[outputs]` section of my `config.toml` from this:

```
[outputs]
    home = ["HTML","RSS"]
    section  = ["HTML"]
```

To this:

```
[outputs]
    home = ["HTML","RSS"]
    section  = ["HTML"]
    taxonomy  = ["HTML"]
    term  = ["HTML"]
```
