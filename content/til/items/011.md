Quick note on an eror I got from Fauna DB recently:

`FetchError: request to https://db.fauna.com/ failed, reason: write EPIPE`

Apparently that happens due to a {{< link-ext "known issue" "docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/drivers/known_issues.html">}} related to AWS Lambda connections (which are also used to execute Netlify functions).

To fix that "frozen execution context", simply change the function to this syntax:

{{< highlight js >}}
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
  const client = new faunadb.Client({
    secret: process.env.FAUNA_SECRET
  });
  const q = faunadb.query;

  // the rest of your code
}
{{< /highlight >}}
