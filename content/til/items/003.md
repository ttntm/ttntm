Use case: a component creates nothing but a `<button>` with a `slot` that handles its display state internally but hasn't got any actual functionality; the handler method is defined in the parent.

In this case, `@click.native` has to be used to call the method defined in the parent:

{{< highlight html >}}

// in parent component

<cButton @click.native="theMethod(praram)">Button Name</cButton>

{{< /highlight >}}
