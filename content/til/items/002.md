title: "Manjaro Linux mount script: BitLocker encrypted external drive"

Got a new external USB 3.0 drive and set up BitLocker encryption. Manjaro (Dolphin) couldn't really do anything with it, kept prompting for the pwd but didn't mount it.

I ended up writing my own mount script that works well so far:

{{< highlight shell >}}

#!/bin/bash

# check first
lsblk -f

# ask user for input
echo -n "input details (fstype bitlocker): "
read device
read -sp 'Magic powder: ' mgk

# mount according to user input
sudo fusermount -u /media/data/drive/ # unmount in case it's still mounted for some reason
sudo dislocker -V /dev/$device -u$mgk -- /media/data/drive
sudo mount -o loop /media/data/drive/dislocker-file /media/data/drive-mnt

echo mounted drive

{{< /highlight >}}

It lists connected block devices first (`lsblk`), so it's not hardcoded to sda/sdb in case that ever changes. Need selection of whatever mentions BitLocker, then asks for the encryption key/pwd and proceeds to mount the drive with `dislocker`. Folders used in `/media/data/` need to exist before the script is executed.
