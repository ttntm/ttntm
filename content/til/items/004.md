I wanted to have an easy way to launch VS Code for specific repositories and came across the `code PATH-TO-REPO` command.

This little shell script will open a specific folder/repository based on an argument given to it or based on a directory listing of the `/home/user/Repos` folder:

{{< highlight shell >}}

#!/bin/bash

# get param
repo=$1

if [ -z "$repo" ]
  then
    # check first
    ls /home/USER/Repos/

    # ask user for input
    echo -n "which repo: "
    read repo
  else
    echo "opening "$repo
fi

code /home/USER/Repos/$repo

{{< /highlight >}}

I've also configured an alias for that script; simply typing `lcode REPO-NAME` now opens VS Code for that folder/repository.
