## freeCodeCamp

I came across <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a> a while ago, bookmarked it and forgot about it again. Going through my bookmarks some weeks ago, I re-discovered it and actually had a look at what they're doing this time. As it turned out, they've got a huge collection of thousands of coding lessons including certifications that they're offering for free based on donations.

I didn't hesitate (this time) and started getting into their first course for the so called _Responsive Web Design Certification_. After the first couple of lessons I realised that this was quite basic for my actual level of knowledge, so I proceeded to working on the 5 certification projects instead. I still plan to catch up on all the individual lessons though, as there's certainly something in there that I forgot over the years or never knew at all.

The projects for the certification were a pleasant experience to complete and I'm quite happy to have obtained the certificate today.

I can wholeheartedly recommend freeCodeCamp for anyone interested in getting into what's called _Responsive Web Design_ there, I'll certainly proceed to JavaScript and work through that next.

If it's of interest for anyone, here's a link to my codepen.io profile where you can have a look at the certification projects: <a href="https://codepen.io/ttntm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">codepen.io/ttntm&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a>

Oh, and that's me on freeCodeCamp: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/ttntm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org/ttntm&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a>

PS: yes, I know that using Bootstrap was a little lazy...
