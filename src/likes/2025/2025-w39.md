## Articles

- [Markdown Is a Disaster: Why and What to Do Instead](https://karl-voit.at/2025/08/17/Markdown-disaster/)
  An interesting read with some good arguments
- [DIY Netlify](https://gomakethings.com/diy-netlify/)
  "Own the process. Own the setup. Own the code." - _YES!_
- [It's time for modern CSS to kill the SPA](https://www.jonoalderson.com/conjecture/its-time-for-modern-css-to-kill-the-spa/)
  "Build like it’s 2025 – not like you’re trapped in a 2018 demo of Gatsby." - this line should probably be on a t-shirt
- [Automating my links list](https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/automating-my-links-list/)
  A cool approach that I might consider adopting for my setup at some point
- [The time is right for a DOM templating API](https://justinfagnani.com/2025/06/26/the-time-is-right-for-a-dom-templating-api/)
  Super curious to see if what - if anything - is going to come out of this
- [I styled my RSS feed with XSLT](https://iyer.ru/2025/08/20/i-styled-my-rss-feed-with-xslt/)
  Might do this, if I find the time, as long as XSLT is still alive
- [Making XML human-readable without XSLT](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/making-xml-human-readable-without-xslt/)
  Another option re: the article linked above this one
- [The Copilot Delusion](https://deplet.ing/the-copilot-delusion/)
  "Defer your thinking to the bot, and we all rot." - couldn't agree more, and another one for a t-shirt

## Links

- [Vintage Macworld Magazine Library](https://vintageapple.org/macworld/)
  I'm not even an Apple user, but I love browsing old magazines sometimes
- [CSS HDR Gradients](https://gradient.style)
  A CSS4 and CSS5 full features gradient generator
- [Open Printer](https://www.crowdsupply.com/open-tools/open-printer)
  A pretty cool device
- [Feedgrab](https://feedgrab.net)
  Quite happy with my current RSS reader, but this one looks _really_ good - might try and switch
- [bgreenwell/doxx](https://github.com/bgreenwell/doxx)
  `.docx` files without leaving your terminal - might try next time someone sends me one of those
