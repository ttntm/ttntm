## Articles

- [The 3 Gurus of 90s Web Design: Zeldman, Siegel, Nielsen](https://cybercultural.com/p/web-design-1997/)
  A very cool article, that sparked a lot of nostalgia in me
- [Don't solve problems you don't have. You're literally creating problems.](https://ohhfishal.net/posts/dont-solve-problems-you-dont-have/)
  Good one, and also something that should be kept in mind whenever starting a new project
- [Small (web) is beautiful](https://fredrocha.net/2025/05/21/small-web-is-beautiful/)
  Very true, indeed; also lots of good links in that post
- [The Psychology Of Stuff: Why We Want More](https://bemorewithless.com/the-psychology-of-stuff/)
  Super interesting, and also useful when asking yourself "what do I actually need in my life?"
- ["Built with Eleventy" Animated 88x31](https://chrisburnell.com/note/eleventy-animated-88x31/)
  This should not need an explanation - go and add it to your 11ty sites now!
- [0x32](https://christianheilmann.com/2025/04/28/0x32/)
  "The 80s were shit" - a harsh reality check for 80s romanticists (like me, occasionally)
- [Old software still has value](https://82mhz.net/posts/2025/05/old-software-still-has-value/)
  "A piece of software might be outdated, [...] but that doesn't mean it's bad and can no longer be used"
