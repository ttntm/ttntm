**Writing**: Migrating notes to my new personal wiki, also working on a bunch of drafts for articles that should have been 2023 blog posts.

**Reading**: Dune Messiah

**Playing**: Borderlands 2, Stellaris, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands

**Drinking**: Lagavulin 16yo - just wow.

**Living**: Missing cycling season, considering going for ice skating more often.
