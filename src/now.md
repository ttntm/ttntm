**Last updated:** May 2nd 2021

## Projects and Writing

- Rewrite {% ext "recept0r", "https://recept0r.com" %} using Vue 3 and TypeScript.
  Wanted to do that earlier, but had to postpone it due to waiting for some dependencies to update first.
- Write an article about securing serverless functions
- Write an article about using `vue-router` to build a menu

## Reading

- Start with {% ext "TypeScript in 50 Lessons", "https://typescript-book.com" %}
- "Permanent Record" by Edward Snowden

## Other

**Playing**:
  - Start: Days Gone, Titanfall 2
  - Finsh: Elex

**Watching**: The Mandalorian (Season 2)

**Misc:**

- Get an OBD adapter and take care of some car coding
- Try and get the cat accustomed to a bit more car travel and a garden
- Upgrade the grill for BBQ season
- Get lucky and pull the trigger on a PS5
- Walk/cycle/swim/... => move more
