A public reminder of what I'm (supposed to be...) doing now.

**Last updated:** Aug. 1st 2021

## Projects and Writing

- Rewrite {% ext "recept0r", "https://recept0r.com" %} using Vue 3 and TypeScript.
  Wanted to do that earlier, but had to postpone it due to waiting for some dependencies to update first.
- Write an article about using `vue-router` to build a menu
- Some volunteering for a privacy focused NGO

## Reading

- Start: "Permanent Record" by Edward Snowden
- Finish: {% ext "TypeScript in 50 Lessons", "https://typescript-book.com" %}

## Other

**Playing**:
  - Start: Inside
  - Finish: Disco Elysium

**Watching**: 
  - Pig
  - Rick & Morty (Season 5)

**Misc:**
- Figure out what to do with a fun TLD I bought last month
- Walk/cycle/swim/... => move more
