**Last updated:** July 28th 2023

**Writing**: planning to write about Preact some more (i.e. rendering a nav tree based on database rows). Also thinking about making my current and past Linux setups available on this website.

**Reading**: re-reading Dune, hope to finish it before the next movie comes out.

**Playing**: Diablo IV; Necromancer, currently at level 78. Also picking up the guitar more often these days, thanks to a new Orange Crush Mini amp I recently got.

**Drinking**: Oban's 14 year old, enjoying it a lot.

**Living**: cycling on a new (to me) Merida MTB I bought in late spring; planning to move a small BBQ grill to the balcony to enjoy some kebab; getting better at standup paddleboarding.
