A public reminder of what I'm (supposed to be...) doing now.

**Last updated:** May 1st 2021

## Projects and Writing

- Rewrite {% ext "recept0r", "https://recept0r.com" %} using Vue 3 and TypeScript.
  Wanted to do that earlier, but had to postpone it due to waiting for some dependencies to update first.
- Write an article about securing serverless functions
- Write an article about using `vue-router` to build a menu

## Reading

- Get and start with {% ext "TypeScript in 50 Lessons", "https://typescript-book.com" %}

## Other

- Get an OBD adapter and take care of some car coding
- Try and get the cat accustomed to a bit more car travel and a garden
- Upgrade the grill for BBQ season
- Walk/cycle/swim/... => move more
