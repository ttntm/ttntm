intro tbd

Anyway, these are some cool things I did last year:

**Work**

- Used Preact to build a pretty cool [data viewer](/blog/building-a-data-viewer-with-preact/)
- Used Astro to build some cool websites
- Got to use Contentful again (last time was around 2019) 
- Published my {% ext "buildless-preact-starter" "https://github.com/ttntm/buildless-preact-starter" %}
- Left a giant corporation behind and moved (back) to an SMB
- Published a library ({% ext "sfmc-utils" "https://github.com/ttntm/sfmc-utils" %}) for one of the systems I'm working with
- Got back into working with process automation / workflow engines (Camunda)

**FOSS & Side Projects**

- Published a TOR Snowflake Proxy at {% ext "relay.iamover.it" "https://relay.iamover.it/" %}
- Published a {% ext "jsonresume theme" "https://github.com/ttntm/jsonresume-theme-rnord" %}
- Published an [Astro version of my landing page template](/blog/astro-tailwind-landing-page-template)
- Started a personal wiki at {% ext "kb.ttntm.me" "https://kb.ttntm.me" %}
- Moved a couple of projects from GitHub to {% ext "Codeberg" "https://codeberg.org/ttntm" %}

**Personal**
