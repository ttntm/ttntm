During summer, my wife and I were entertaining the thought of moving to a bigger/better/... apartment. We started looking, and quickly realized that we can't afford what we like, and that we don't really like most apartments and houses we could actually afford. We made our peace with that, and let it go for the time being.

A couple of weeks ago, I took the bus to work and saw a bunch of "for sale" signs about 2 stops from where we currently live. I looked the place up online, and liked what I saw - a ground floor apartment of 83 m², with a 105 m² garden, situated in a building that's barely 2 years old. And listed for a price that we could actually manage to pay. I sent my wife there, while I was at work, and she also liked what she saw.

We arranged a showing with the realtor some days later, and weren't disappointed by the inside of the place either. What followed, were a couple of stressful weeks, figuring things out with banks, preparing an offer, and working on getting it accepted. Right now, we're in the middle of buying the place, and there's just _so much_ to do - tons of documents, phone calls, appointments, planning etc., all while trying my best to find 8 hours for work every day.

I'm glad that my situation at work is very convenient at the moment. I'm basically working on my tickets and tasks alone, which allows for weird, irregular hours, and the flexibility we currently need with everything else going on.

So yeah, it's all a bit much for me these days, and it'll probably stay like that for weeks, if not months - until we've moved and settled into the new place, I suppose. There's hardly any time left for anything else right now, so one could consider this post some kind of early notice of hibernation until things ease up a little.

Having said that, I'll get back to work now, my lunch break's over.
