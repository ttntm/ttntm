It's been seven years since [Hello World](/blog/hello-world/). _A lot_ has happened since then, in the world, in my life, and also on this website.

What started as a minimal blog, grew into a proper online home for myself. Collections and pages were added, additional features and functionality came hand in hand with them. Infrastructure and tools changed over the years too, and will probably keep changing. A personal website working as intended, I guess, and offering a perfect testing ground for new ideas, technologies, and really just about anything that one feels like doing within (or even beyond) the limitations of the web as a medium.

When wondering about the "why" in what I'm doing here, I often remind myself that I'm really just running this website for myself. But I will gladly admit that the occasional feature of an article in a larger newsletter, new online acquaintances, and a steady stream of 10-15k unique visitors/month do actually feel great. I have zero interest in "building a brand", or monetizing anything, but I believe, and hope, that what I'm doing here might end up being helpful for someone else out there in a way - as entertainment, information, or even inspiration, maybe.

## What's Next?

I don't think I can find better words than what's already been written for the [Appendix](/appendix/): this website should "feel like me and change with me", and "offer content about things that matter to me".

That's some pretty decent principles that I intend to adhere to. And considering the amount of past changelog entries, future changes are basically a certainty anyway.
