A chronological list of my favorite albums from 2010 to 2019 with reasons why I like them.

As of late 2024, this is the final post in the [#albums](/tags/albums/) series.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/c-cc2.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Crystal Castles - Crystal Castles (II)", "Release: 2010" %}

A weird record, that I discovered while exploring witch house music.

I ended up liking it at lot for its weirdness, and for songs like "Celestica" and "Baptism".

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/ng-ng.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "NiT GriT - NiT GriT", "Release: 2010" %}

More electronic music.

I can't quite remember how I found out about this album, but the song "Let me die" reminded me of the (phenomenal!) Unreal Tournament soundtrack that I used to listen to _a lot_ when I was 12.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/m-whtn.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Mgła - With Hearts Toward None", "Release: 2012" %}

An absolute masterpiece, and definitely among the best Black Metal albums I know. It's a fierce, dark record that's evil to the bone. It's also showcasing Mgła's mastery of musical craftsmanship - both composition and delivery of the tracks on this record are outstanding.

The final track, VII, has a very special place in my heart; it's left a mark so deep, that the mere thought of it sends a shiver down my spine -- "Always downwards - and toward the farthest sides of the north!"

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/p-iatn.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Perturbator - I am the Night", "Release: 2012" %}

An album that I loved from the very first second I listened to it.

Enjoying it so much was weird at first, considering that I listened to metal almost exclusively at the time. It's also a considerably significant record for me, because it introduced me to the Synthwave/Retrowave genre, which became one of my favorite non-metal music genres.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/b-c.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Beastmilk - Climax", "Release: 2013" %}

A pretty great album, that includes catchy sing-along tracks like "The Wind Blows Through Their Skulls", "Nuclear Winter", and "Genocidal Crush".

Musically, this record probably fits in somewhere between (Post-)Punk, New-Wave and Gothic Rock. It sounds great, and I often find myself pulling it out of my record shelf.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/md-h.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Mega Drive - Hardwired", "Release: 2013" %}

Another Synthwave album.

On this list because of kickass tracks like "Completely Circuitry", "Delta Protocol" and "I am a Program". These standout tracks were remixed by other greats of the genre, and these remixes are featured on the extended version of this album, "Hardwired V1.4", from 2015.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/dc-potf.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Dead Congregation - Promulgation of the Fall", "Release: 2014" %}

An outstanding Death Metal record that shows how Dead Congregation are among the masters of the genre. It's a worthy successor to their debut that delivers dark and brutally obscure tracks that could be compared to bands like Deicide, Immolation, or Incantation.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/d-sc.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Domains - Sinister Ceremonies", "Release: 2014" %}

Got to know about this album randomly, saw it mentioned a newsletter, I think, and decided to give it a try. And hell, that was a good decision!

"Sinister Ceremonies" is one of the best Death Metal albums of this decade, without a doubt, and probably among the best ever. It's a razor sharp record, full of dark, occult energy, backed by a surprisingly refined production that leaves a very professional impression.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/md-198xad.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Mega Drive - 198XAD", "Release: 2014" %}

An album full of superb tracks. Also, my favorite Mega Drive album, and one of my favorites of the Synthwave genre.

It's hard to just pick a few, but some of my favorites from this album are: "Acid Spit", "Osaka Sewers", and "Zero Point Non-Response".

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/p-dd.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Perturbator - Dangerous Days", "Release: 2014" %}

More Perturbator, more killer Synthwave.

My favorite album of this artist, complete with tracks like "Raw Power", "Future Club", and "Humans Are Such Easy Prey" that get the blood pumping. Also, an excellent workout soundtrack.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/vd-ta.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "VHS Dreams - Trans Am", "Release: 2015" %}

One of my favorite highway driving albums, and something I'd imagine would be a great soundtrack for a remake of the movie "Vanishing Point".

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/mbr-ip.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Master Boot Record - Internet Protocol", "Release: 2019" %}

An album that became one of my favorites very quickly.

The music sits right at the intersection of metal and electronic music, which resonated with me almost immediately. Also, the songs on this album are all named after actual internet protocols, so one finally knows what FTP sounds like in 2019.
