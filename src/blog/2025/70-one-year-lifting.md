We visited Portugal last year. I still remember how heavy the luggage felt that we had with us: 2 suitcases, weighing around 20 kg each.

One year later, I now joke about that, and laugh, whenever I tell anyone about it. I didn't think much of it at the time, but these suitcases pissed me off so much that I got back into lifting weights. That's something I'd only briefly been doing during my early 20s, but stopped at some point. A brand-new gym opening around the corner from where we live, only a couple of weeks prior to the suitcase frustration, certainly helped with that.

Nowadays, I'm handling 500 times more weight than that ridiculous 20 kg suitcase on an average Wednesday. Or Monday. And also on Friday.

In the past, I worked out at home. I owned a bench, a barbell, weight plates, dumbbells and a lot of other stuff that I eventually ran out of space for when my girlfriend, now wife, moved in. What followed, were comfortable years of sedentary life, with the occasional bike ride, swim, or walk. No proper exercise, just _lots_ of sitting.

I also lost weight gradually, probably due to my insane metabolism, and went down to less than ~70 kg measured in June '24. That's not concerningly low, but also far from ideal for a 188 cm tall man. No wonder I felt weak. I _was_ weak.

## Taking Action

Joining a gym is one thing, but you've also got to go there and do something useful. Fortunately, I still had some old training plan lying around, some pretty basic stuff for absolute beginners. I started with that, but quickly realized just how useless it actually was. Not saying that I'm an expert trainer or anything, but if you've got half a brain and only a minimal sense of feeling your own body, a waste of time becomes obvious easily.

I switched to {% ext "GZCLP", "https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2016/02/gzcl-applications-adaptations.html" %} (GZCL Linear Progression for new lifters) on July 19th '25 and did two 12-week cycles of the program. Working through it was extremely motivating, and the results came in as expected. Easy novice gains, well deserved.

When I got close to finishing the first cycle, around December '24, I had to deal with increasingly bothersome hip pain from squatting. I managed to find the reason (long femurs), and also figured out how to fix it: proper shoes that elevate the heel, and a couple of weeks of re-learning proper technique. No more pain.

After GZCLP, I did a month of arm specialization. Another program I had lying around from the past. It was ok, results were good, and it made me realize that I should focus on arms in the assistance work of the next long term program.

Research and decision-making took me a couple of weeks, but I eventually chose something simple, with proven results, and ended up with {% ext "5/3/1 for Beginners", "https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner" %}. I started the program on June 9th '25, and I'm very happy with my choice. I just finished the second week of my third 3-week cycle, and progress has been very good so far: tons of volume, and manageable recovery.

## Results

Lifting 100 kg off the floor for the first time felt _amazing_, and my deadlift is at a comfortable 130 kg now. I haven't tested for a 1RM in a while, but I like to believe that 140 kg should be possible.

Squatting 100 kg was scary the first time, but worked out surprisingly well. I did 105 kg in April '25, but haven't tested for anything higher than that yet.

Bench strength is growing slower, but there is good progress: from sub 40 kg reps a year ago, to a 1RM of 70+ kg (haven't tested above 70 yet).

And then there's the overhead press. Weakest for most, even more so for weak-shouldered computer workers - I started with the empty bar (20 kg), and got it up to 50+ kg in a year.

Progress was also made with my body weight. I gained about 15 kg, reaching a total mass of 90 kg, and I'm at a comfortable 88 kg now. I still eat _everything_, and I've definitely got to reduce the body fat percentage soon. But: I look healthy (maybe even fit?) now, and I had to get a couple of new clothes.

On to another year of lifting heavy stuff off the ground, I guess - let's see where this journey takes me.
