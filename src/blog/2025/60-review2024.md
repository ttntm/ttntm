Wow, it's been a quarter of a century since Y2K.
We all know that time flies, but it still feels surreal sometimes.

Saying that 2024 was a rather uneventful year would probably be too much, but at least at work, it was a lot of "business as usual". The small company I'm with grew a little larger, we're about 30 people now. My responsibilities mostly stayed the same, but I got into some cool new projects and made good use of past work experience, especially working with process driven automation/workflow engines. I also got to work with a new (to me) headless CMS, and lead a small team to a successful relaunch of our company website.

Highlights from my personal life include my wife getting her Austrian citizenship, a wonderful trip to Portugal (including my first scuba diving experience), and getting back into weight lifting.

To follow the series' established format, these are some highlights from last year:

**Work**

- Worked as an architect/team lead on the relaunch of our company website (built on Azure using Astro/Kontent.ai and interfaces to CMS/recruiting)
- Proved expertise with process driven automation/workflow engines and became de facto architect for two custom software development projects using process-driven orchestration
- Got some certifications
  - Back End Development and APIs (FCC)
  - <span>Kontent.ai</span> Developer

**FOSS & Side Projects**

- Started a web directory called {% ext "BUKMARK.CLUB", "https://bukmark.club" %} and grew it to 241 listings
- Re-launched {% ext "bundestrojaner.at", "https://bundestrojaner.at" %} using 11ty (with the help of my wife, who did the re-design)
- Got most of {% ext "recept0r v3", "https://codeberg.org/ttntm/recept0r/milestone/6230" %} done
- Built and published an {% ext "astro-potfolio-starter", "https://github.com/ttntm/astro-potfolio-starter/" %}
- Started working on a CMS migration incl. website relaunch for a nonprofit organization (Astro/Contentful)
- [Published 24 blog posts](/blog/#2024), and [added a ton of features, pages etc.](/tags/evolution/) to this website

My commit activity for 2024 looks like this:

**Personal Life**

- Wife finally got her Austrian citizenship
- Had a good time in Portugal (Lisbon/Porto), also tried scuba diving
