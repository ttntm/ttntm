Others wrote about their share of the "Millennial nostalgia", and I enjoyed reading about their memories very much:

The following is a list of some of the things I remember from growing up in the 1990s and early 2000s in Central Europe.

## Lifestyle

- Trading cards
  - NBA Basketball in elementary school
  - Pok√©mon and MTG in high school
- A teenage obsession with skateboarding, thanks to the Tony Hawk games, and failing badly in real life
- Jeans full of holes - it got so bad, that grandma once gave me some money and told me to stop looking like a bum, meaning I was supposed to buy "proper" pants and wear them next time, just to prove I used the money for the right thing
- Smoking was cool unfortunately - I managed to quit when I was 28, after 15 years

## Music & TV

- Taping radio to cassette for the car and/or the (used) Walkman I got from some older relative that upgraded to MiniDisc
- Taping TV (i.e. Star Wars) to VHS because it ran so long past bedtime that this was the only deal my parents would accept (I was about 6 then)
- Watching Dragon Ball Z on TV - 5 mins of new stuff, 5 mins each for recap/preview and a 5 min ad break in between
- Watching MTV, when they were still (mostly) a music channel
- Watching TV series... on TV - one episode per week, with a repeat late in the night a day or two later, in case you missed it or forgot to tape it
- Warez
    - Early mp3 dealings, managing a music library with Winamp
    - Movie downloads, and burning to multiple CDs just to watch a single film on the slightly bigger TV screen in front of the couch
- Video rentals, first on VHS, then on DVD

## Video Games

- Reading gaming magazines while offline on vacation, obsessing over things I didn't have yet, i.e. Diablo 2
- Complimentary CDs that came with gaming magazines - they included free/shareware, game demos, and sometimes even full versions
- Going to the store to buy PC games that came in beautiful boxes and with a printed manual
- Having a shared family PC for internet access
    - Paying Diablo in the living room full of guests during New Year's Eve
    - ICQ, and the "fun" of having overly curious family members around
    - One day, a porn site appeared as our browser start page, and everybody denied responsibility for it - wasn't me, and I still don't know who's to blame a quarter of century later...
- LAN parties, and having to make someone drive you (and your bulky PC) there
- Summer holidays full of
    - Game Boy Super Mario, without a save function
    - Age of Empires and Diablo I/II, which ran on old company laptops my father could borrow for us
    - PlayStation matches with the neighbors kids, who had a Dragon Ball fighting game that was insanely fun
- My parents' reaction to games like GTA 3 or Quake III Arena - not exactly fun conversations to have as a teenager...
- Hundreds (thousands?) of hours spent on CounterStrike (the early days, 1.6 and before)

## Tech

- Getting my first email address, which came with 25 MB of webspace (FTP access)
- Early mobile phone customization with banners and ringtones
- Using all my prepaid phone credit for SMS
- Building my first gaming PC - it had a GeForce 3 that could even handle Doom 3 a couple of years later
- Building my first websites, feeling like I can do everything on the web
- Mobile phones kept getting smaller - I actually broke one of mine when I accidentally scored during a game of basketball, the phone flew through the net together with the ball
- My first mp3 player, and the freedom that came with it
