The alpha release of Eleventy v3 became available in December '23. It took me a little while, but I finally upgraded this website to `v3.0.0-alpha.10` today.

**This is what I had to do:**

Updated `package.json` and switched to ESM using `"type": "module"`.

The old `.eleventy.js` config file became `eleventy.config.js` and all `require()` statements were turned into `import`s. The file now uses the `export default async function(config) {}` syntax, gone is the old CJS `module.exports = async function(config) {}`.

The `filters.js` and `shortcodes.js` files had to be updated too, same procedure changes the config file (imports/export).

Then there were 2 things that broke:

1, Importing `*.json` files from the file system failed.

Solved by annotating the import with `assert { type: 'json' }`, which made it work again. But: there's a warning in the console now:

```txt
(node:17578) ExperimentalWarning: Importing JSON modules is an experimental feature and
might change at any time (Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)`.
```

2, Using `__dirname` isn't possible anymore.

It was used in my CSS build (`page.11ty.js`) and broke builds. I actually had to look this up and found a workaround for it:

```js
import path from 'path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename)

//...

const cssDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', '_includes', 'css')
const rawFilepath = path.join(cssDir, '_page.css')
```

Other than that, things kept working without any issues, and I'm happily reading console output like this:

```txt
[11ty] Benchmark    643ms  18%   769× (Configuration) "slugify" Nunjucks Filter
[11ty] Benchmark    870ms  25%   309× (Configuration) "jsmin" Nunjucks Async Filter
[11ty] Benchmark    580ms  16%   200× (Configuration) "htmlmin" Transform
[11ty] Copied 171 files / Wrote 137 files in 3.35 seconds (24.5ms each, v3.0.0-alpha.10)
```

BTW, development builds (via `eleventy --serve`) skip the HTML/JS minification and are even faster:

```txt
[11ty] Benchmark    647ms  31%   769× (Configuration) "slugify" Nunjucks Filter
[11ty] Copied 171 files / Wrote 137 files in 1.88 seconds (13.7ms each, v3.0.0-alpha.10)
```

All changes I had to do can be found in a PR if you're interested: {% ext "ttntm/pull/16/files", "https://github.com/ttntm/ttntm/pull/16/files" %}

Overall a smooth upgrade that I recommend doing if your site also runs on Eleventy. And if not, consider giving it a shot - it's a fantastic tool with a great community!
