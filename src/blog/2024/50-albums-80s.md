A chronological list of my favorite albums from 1980 to 1989 with reasons why I like them.

Also, the opening post of my new [#albums](/tags/albums/) series.

<div class="hr shadow mt2 mb2"></div>

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/bs-hah.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Black Sabbath - Heaven and Hell", "Release: 1980" %}

Black Sabbath's first album with Ronnie James Dio as their singer.

The A-side is nothing short of phenomenal and the title track, "Heaven and Hell", is definitely one of the greatest Heavy Metal songs of its time.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/bf-d.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Black Flag - Damaged", "Release: 1981" %}

A classic hardcore (punk) record.

Raw, unadulterated musical violence that inspired countless other bands and influenced a multitude of musical genres. And "Rise Above" should definitely be considered one of the best opening tracks ever.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/m-wau.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Misfits - Walk Among Us", "Release: 1982" %}

The first Misfits album. I love most of their music up until and including "Famous Monsters", but "Walk Among Us" is definitely my favorite.

I got into the band in the late 90s and "Famous Monsters" was my first Misfits album. I still love listening to "Scream" sometimes (and watching that fantastic music video!), but when I discovered "Walk Among Us", it felt so much more honest and raw that it quickly became the soundtrack of my early teenage years.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/d-hnsnsn.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Discharge - Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing", "Release: 1982" %}

Another classic hardcore record.

I bought Discharge's self-titled album around the time it was released (2002) and loved what I got. I treasured my then-new discovery and ended up with "Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing" shortly after that.

It's a great record and I don't think its influence on metal and extreme music in general can be overstated.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/m-rtl.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Metallica - Ride the Lightning", "Release: 1984" %}

It's quite hard to pick just one favorite Metallica album for the whole 1980s.

In my early 20s, I would definitely have picked "Kill 'Em All", but 35+ years old me went with this one instead. The main reasons for that decision are "Fight Fire With Fire", "Creeping Death" and "Trapped Under Ice", but "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and "Fade to Black" are great songs too.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/s-ha.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Slayer - Hell Awaits", "Release: 1985" %}

Definitely my favorite Slayer album.

I saw this album described as "ahead of its time" somewhere, and I can only agree. It's a violent rush all the way to the end and there isn't a single bad (or even not-so-good) song on this record. The craftsmanship is close to perfection too, and trying to play these riffs with thin teenager skin will make your fingers bleed (trust me, I tried).

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/im-sit.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Iron Maiden - Somewhere in Time", "Release: 1986" %}

My favorite Iron Maiden album.

"Powerslave" might be their universally acclaimed masterpiece, but "Somewhere in Time" has "Wasted Years", the first Iron Maiden song I ever listened to. My brain probably got fried a little that day, I still remember it as if it happened yesterday.

Also, really cool album artwork!

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/k-ptk.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Kreator - Pleasure to Kill", "Release: 1986" %}

My favorite Kreator album.

A furious German thrash metal record that's intense, relentless and full of aggression:

I remember wearing a matching t-shirt to a first aid class and having an interesting conversation about the album title printed on the back of the shirt - fun times!

Fun fact: also featured in one of the earlier episodes of the TV series "Dark".

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/d-sbg.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Death - Scream Bloody Gore", "Release: 1987" %}

The first death metal album.

Possessed's "Seven Churches" came out a little earlier, but it was still very much rooted in thrash metal. Death definitely crossed that line and delivered a masterpiece that still sounds fresh today.

A long time ago, I hunted down the original Combat Records version on eBay. It's one of the few records that having a first press somehow mattered to me.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/ma-aom.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Morbid Angel - Altars of Madness", "Release: 1989" %}

Another death metal masterpiece full of songs I will never forget about. A record that's pretty much "all killer, no filler", and definitely - still - one of the best records of the whole genre.

I never got into later Morbid Angel records (after "Blessed are the Sick"), but I'll always argue that this is their best album anyway.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/t-wd.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Terrorizer - World Downfall", "Release: 1989" %}

I suppose that many of the records listed above eventually culminated in this one.

"World Downfall" is a monument of extreme music and leaves behind nothing but sonic destruction.

Some highlights: "After World Obliteration", "Fear of Napalm" and "Dead Shall Rise".
