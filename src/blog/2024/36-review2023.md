As another year comes to an end, writing this post feels like something I was actually looking forward to.

I recently changed jobs and went back to an SMB after almost 2 years at a large enterprise. The first 9 months of 2022 were quite a downward spiral: good people left and their replacements came with huge delays and were lacking in many areas. Well performing teams broke up and bad management paired with insufficient internal communication killed most people's motivation. Needless to say that I'm happy I got out when I did.

In terms of my personal life, I'm quite happy that I managed to increase my overall activity level. Getting a new (to me) bike, purchasing a standup paddleboard and leaving the house more (new office) were all helpful in this regard. I hope I'll manage to keep it up.

To follow the series' established format, these are some cool things I did last year:

**Work**

- Used Preact to build a pretty cool [buildless data viewer SPA](/blog/building-a-data-viewer-with-preact/)
- Used Astro to build some cool websites
- Got to use Contentful again (last time was around 2019)
- Published a {% ext "buildless-preact-starter" "https://github.com/ttntm/buildless-preact-starter" %}
- Left a large enterprise behind and moved (back) to an SMB
- Published a library ({% ext "sfmc-utils" "https://github.com/ttntm/sfmc-utils" %}) for one of the systems I'm working with
- Got back into working with process driven workflow engines (Camunda)

**FOSS & Side Projects**

- Published a TOR Snowflake Proxy at {% ext "relay.iamover.it" "https://relay.iamover.it/" %}
- Published a {% ext "jsonresume theme" "https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-rnord" %} to NPM
- Published an [Astro version of my landing page template](/blog/astro-tailwind-landing-page-template)
- Started a public personal wiki at {% ext "kb.ttntm.me" "https://kb.ttntm.me" %}
- Moved a couple of projects from GitHub to {% ext "Codeberg" "https://codeberg.org/ttntm" %}

My GitHub contributions for 2022 look like this:

**Personal Life**

- Got a new (to me) bike after 15+ years of buyers regret from my previous bike
- Learned a ton about bicycle maintenance and DIY'ed everything I needed so far
- Got into standup paddleboarding and loved it
- Got to know about and started using {% ext "Omnivore" "https://omnivore.app" %}

**Significant Growth**

- **Personal**: increasing my activity level in general and also using the bike for many things I would've used the car for 1 year ago
- **Professional**: standardizing code in a way that makes well known errors disappear reliably

**Persistent Challenges**

- **Personal**: multitasking and context switching
- **Professional**: dealing with insufficient project management, missing requirements and bad documentation

**Best _ of 2023**

- **Drink**: Lagavulin 16yo
- **Game**: Armored Core VI
- **Movie**: John Wick: Chapter 4
- **Series**: Silo (Beef as a close 2nd)
