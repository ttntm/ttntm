## What Happened?

Judging by the silence here, I must have been busy...

The christmas holiday brought along Rockstar's _Red Dead Redemption 2_, some well deserved relaxation and good company of family and friends.

I took on a project for a friend some weeks before that though, she needed a portfolio website. The site's done from a technical perspective, currently being filled with content as it's supposed to go online soon.

Aside from that, I also managed to get another website project for a startup which will start within the next weeks or as soon as the design is finished.

### Updates!

As far as this site's concerned, here's what's changed:

- moved from Github pages and their `username.github.io` domain to **ttntm.me** which was on sale at porkbun.com
- moved the deployment over to Netlify
- enabled an RSS feed for the blog - subscribe at [ttntm.me/feed.xml](https://ttntm.me/feed.xml)

### Coming Soon

- planning to ditch gulp, replacing it with Hugo's native asset processing functionality
- <s>going to build a projects/portfolio section into this site</s> - *Update 03/2019: done!*
