2nd entry in this series that I've decided to call "About the Past Year" from now on.

2022 wasn't an easy year: we lost a family member to ALS (about 18 months after the diagnosis) and had to cope with loss, an international move and a lot of other things that needed taking care of given this new situation. It's been getting easier lately, but there's a lot left to take care of.

Work was really supportive in this situation and I had absolutely no problems working remotely and taking days off as needed. A bunch of new projects started recently though, so I'm hoping for an additional team member within the next few weeks right now.

Anyway, these are some cool things I did last year:

**Work**

- Built a transactional SMS sending service with blackout functionality (i.e. considering holidays, weekends, nighttime hours etc. and delaying the messages accordingly)
- Worked on a larger Nuxt codebase and built a front end for a tour booking solution
- Built an SMS based MFA service with basic session management
- Implemented a multichannel personalization tool
- Architected and implemented an interface that processes Facebook leads, checks their data in CRM and triggers automated marketing communication (multiple FB pages, one CRM, multiple campaigns in different languages)
- Lead {% ext "MJML" "https://mjml.io" %} adoption in my team
- Built a media library SPA with Preact
- Switched to Fedora on my work laptop - 0 regrets

**Other**

- Added support for `prefers-color-scheme` in {% ext "aitrack.work" "http://aitrack.work" %} ({% ext "PR#20@Codeberg" "https://codeberg.org/ttntm/itrack/pulls/20" %})
- Did some theming
  - Firefox: {% ext "minimal-one-line-firefox" "https://github.com/ttntm/minimal-one-line-firefox" %}
  - cmus: {% ext "Tokyo Night Theme for cmus" "https://github.com/ttntm/cmus-tokyo-night" %}
- Implemented drag'n'drop sorting in 2 of my personal projects
  - Also wrote about it recently: [Building an Editable List with Drag and Drop Sorting in Vue3](/blog/building-an-editable-list-with-drag-and-drop-sorting-in-vue3/)
- Managed to beat Malenia in less than 10 attempts

**Most Significant Growth**

- Personal: quit preemptively helping people that can't acknowledge that they have a problem (and learning to live with the frustration of things being that way in the first place)
- Professional: substituting lacking project management more or less efficiently and learning to tolerate it

TBH, not sure if either one of those is necessarily a good thing.

**Most Persistent Challenges**

- Personal: learning to cope with loss
- Professional: context switching, multitasking, learning not to care too much

**Best _ of 2022**

- Game: Elden Ring (Stray as a close 2nd)
- Movie: Bullet Train
- Series: Severance
