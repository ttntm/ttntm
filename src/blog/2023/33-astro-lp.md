Earlier this week, I ported my "simple landing page" template to {% ext "Astro", "https://astro.build" %}.

I initially published it for Hugo in July 2020, followed by an 11ty version in March 2021.

Working with Astro was quite pleasant; I'd used it before (late summer/autumn 2022), but I had to consult the documentation for some things that changed in the meantime and also for a couple of other things that I simply forgot.

## Good Things

- Excellent {% ext "documentation", "https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/" %}
- Easy use of existing data files (i.e. JSON)
- Great {% ext "Tailwind CSS integration", "https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/#overview" %} that worked OOTB
- {% ext "TypeScript support", "https://docs.astro.build/en/install/manual/#6-add-typescript-support" %} (i.e. component props)

## Other Things

- The (JSX-like) template language; probably just takes time to get used toâ€¦
- Some weirdness with the syntax highlighting in *.astro files (using the official VS Code "Language support for Astro" extension)
