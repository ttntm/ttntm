Judging by the silence here, I must have been busy...

The christmas holiday brought along Rockstar's _Red Dead Redemption 2_, some well deserved relaxation and good company of family and friends.

I took on a project for a friend some weeks before that though, she needed a portfolio website. The site's done from a technical perspective, currently being filled with content as it's supposed to go online soon.

Aside from that, I also managed to get another website project for a startup which will start within the next weeks or as soon as the design is finished.

## Updates!

As far as this site's concerned, here's what's changed:

- Moved from Github pages and their `username.github.io` domain to [ttntm.me](https://ttntm.me) which was on sale at Porkbun
- Moved the deployment over to Netlify
- Enabled an RSS feed for the blog - subscribe at [/feed.xml](/feed.xml)

## Coming Soon

- Planning to ditch gulp, replacing it with Hugo's native asset processing functionality
- <s>Going to build a projects/portfolio section into this site</s> - *Update 03/2019: done!*
