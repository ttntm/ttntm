If you had told me a year ago, that I'd be living in a new apartment now, I wouldn't have taken you seriously, laughing very hard...

But somehow, we ended up finding a great place, without really looking for one, bought it, and moved within 3 months, give or take. I wrote [about how it all started](/blog/out-of-time/) some months ago, and I won't get back into that, so this post is about what happened since then.

Our apartment's in a building that was finished in 2023, and nobody ever lived there. As such, one of the first things to take care of was the getting a kitchen. We looked at out options, compared some offers, and ended up with Ikea eventually - they offered the best value for our limited budget, which made it possible to get some proper kitchen appliances. We kept our trusty old dishwasher, only to learn that it's a bit too short for Ikea's 80cm countertop heights. A solution was found, however: the dishwasher now stands on top of a spare part of the kitchen countertop, and it works well.

Other than taking care of getting a kitchen, we also painted most walls, added some wood paneling to a corridor, and put Ethernet cables into our walls before the actual moving process even started.

Regarding furniture, we didn't take much of what we had, because our old apartment was sold with about 80% of all furniture that was in it. So, we only had to move 2 tables, some chairs, and some living room furniture (some shelves and vitrines). We had to build a ton of new furniture however, and there was an abundance of stuff to pack into boxes, and to move.

Most of the actual move was done using a big Volvo that we could borrow from my family, and the proximity of the 2 apartments helped immensely. This process of packing, moving, and unpacking took us about 3 weeks - we made good use of the Christmas holiday season. About halfway through these 3 weeks, on Dec. 28th, we moved the cat, and slept in the new place for the first time. He did exceptionally well, much better than expected, and is happy there since then.

January 12th was the day we gave the keys to our old place to its new owners, so that'd be the official "done moving" date. There was a ton of stuff left to do though, and we've been working on that ever since. By now, everything's mostly gone to normal, and the things we did recently we're basically just the finishing touches - the last missing ceiling lights, some tiles here and there, and some purposefully picked pieces of furniture to fill the inevitable gaps (both in terms of looks, and usability).

Ultimately, we're happy that we moved the way we did (i.e. gradually). Yes, it was stressful and exhausting, but overall, it worked out as planned, and we learned that we can take care of a lot of things ourselves. Working on our own place, using our tools, and some skills we didn't know we had, felt rewarding and has become something that we'll keep doing.

It'll be spring soon, and that means that an entirely new chapter will be starting soon: taking care of our garden.
