A list of 40 Questions to ask yourself every year.

I saw it {% ext "elsewhere", "https://stephango.com/40-questions" %}, and decided to give it a go.

--

**_What did you do this year that you'd never done before?_**

Bought a new apartment.

**_Did you keep your new year's resolutions?_**

Didn't have any, and generally don't do that.

**_Did anyone close to you give birth?_**

My new next door neighbors, they're close by proximity.

**_Did anyone close to you die?_**

No, unless Ozzy counts.

**_What cities/states/countries did you visit?_**

Munich, for a work trip in May.

**_What would you like to have next year that you lacked this year?_**

An actual vacation - spent most of my time off on moving to the new place.

**_What date(s) from this year will remain etched upon your memory, and why?_**

"Back to the Beginning", on July 5th, the final concert of Black Sabbath in its original lineup. And signing the contract for the new apartment, on Oct. 17th, probably a once in a lifetime thing.

**_What was your biggest achievement of the year?_**

Getting the new apartment. And a 130 kg deadlift. And profit on our ETF investment, despite having bought into them at the peak before that fuckery in early March.

**_What was your biggest failure?_**

A 140 kg deadlift. And taking a guitar to a store for a sale on commission - would like to get it back, but the damn store's never open, it seems.

**_What other hardships did you face?_**

DIY-ing our move to the new place was a lot more exhausting and time-consuming than we anticipated.

Also, our cat had to go to the hospital in summer, and stay there for about a week. That was tough.

**_Did you suffer illness or injury?_**

A mild flu at the beginning of the year, despite having been vaccinated.

**_What was the best thing you bought?_**

A PRS SE Hollowbody Standard electric guitar. And the "Back to the Beginning" live stream ticket, for the final concert of Black Sabbath in its original lineup.

**_Whose behavior merited celebration?_**

Some guy at one of the banks we asked for loan offers at. Called back on a Sunday, worked until the late evening, and had that offer ready the same day. That's basically unheard of in Austria.

**_Whose behavior made you appalled?_**

Realtors, and their whole business model basically. And the lawyers, notaries and courts, with their never ending fees.

**_Where did most of your money go?_**

The new apartment.

**_What did you get really, really, really excited about?_**

The "Back to the Beginning" concert, the new apartment, and having a garden now.

**_What song will always remind you of this year?_**

The whole Black Sabbath set from "Back to the Beginning", and "Perihelion" by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (I'm still shocked to have ignored that band for so many years, they're great).

**_Compared to this time last year, are you: happier or sadder? Richer or poorer? Healthier or unhealthier?_**

Happier, poorer, and healthier.

**_What do you wish you'd done more of?_**

Working on side projects, bicycling, swimming in summer.

**_What do you wish you'd done less of?_**

Packing boxes, going to furniture stores, carrying boxes.

**_How are you spending the holidays?_**

We moved to the new apartment.

**_Did you fall in love this year?_**

No. Unless the new guitar counts.

**_Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?_**

No.

**_What was your favorite show?_**

Alien: Earth

**_What was the best book you read?_**

I had a lot of fun reading "Iron Man", the Tony Iommi biography, but "If Cats Disappeared from the World" was great too.

**_What was your greatest musical discovery of the year?_**

King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard

**_What was your favorite film?_**

"Ballerina", with "Bugonia", and "Dracula: A Love Tale" as close contenders.

**_What was your favorite meal?_**

We went to a small Asian restaurant called "Mochi" for our wedding anniversary, and the food there was really great.

**_What did you want and get?_**

A hollowbody electric guitar.

**_What did you want and not get?_**

Too many things, probably, but nothing that really mattered.

**_What did you do on your birthday?_**

Went to one of the hot springs with my wife.

**_What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?_**

An actual week or two of holidays away from home. Also maybe better conditions on the loan for the apartment, but that's probably illusory anyway.

**_How would you describe your personal fashion this year?_**

Same as always, I guess?

**_What kept you sane?_**

Getting back into playing guitar, some really great video games (i.e. Kingdom Come II, Stellar Blade, Expedition 33, CarX Street, Rogue Trader).

**_Which celebrity/public figure did you admire the most?_**

Don't know, don't care.

**_What political issue stirred you the most?_**

No comment.

**_Who did you miss?_**

My father, who died in 2022.

**_Who was the best new person you met?_**

A new colleague at work.

**_What valuable life lesson did you learn this year?_**

Both me, and my wife, are stubborn as hell, which hasn't changed in almost 10 years of being together.

Also, my craftsmanship skills are better than I thought, and pricier tools are actually worth it, and have a huge impact on the result (i.e. a cut made with a proper circular saw and a guide rail, instead of a cheapo jigsaw).

**_What is a quote that sums up your year?_**

"Constant dropping wears away a stone" - with regard to moving apartments, which seemed overwhelming at first, progressed slowly, but eventually concluded successfully.
