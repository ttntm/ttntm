The first 2/3 of 2025 were rather uneventful, business - and life - as usual. The final 1/3 was absolute madness, because we bought a new apartment and severely underestimated what it means to move after having amassed things and stuff for more than 10 years. We finally moved into the new place last Sunday, Dec. 28th, but we're still moving our belongings around in boxes. I've got 11 more days left until I have to go back to work, and I can only hope we'll manage to get it all done until then.

Anyway, these are some highlights from last year:

**Work**

- Accidentally ended up doing too much requirements engineering during the first half of the year, realized in time, and got myself out of that project; it all started harmlessly, "helping out some colleagues", but it soon turned into meeting- and prose-hell, which is not for me - I prefer reading/writing/discussing code
- Only good projects after that
- Also "big new project" since October, which is really nice (almost no context switching)

**FOSS & Side Projects**

- Finally implemented webmentions on this website, then rewrote most of it a couple of months later
- Finished working on a CMS migration incl. website relaunch for a nonprofit organization (Astro/Contentful)
- Migrated 2 projects from Fauna to Supabase, after Fauna got EoL'd
- Finally relaunched my wife's website (Astro/Contentful)
- Celebrated the [7 years anniversary](/blog/seven-years/) of this website
- [Published 14 blog posts](/blog/#2025), and [added a few things](/tags/evolution/) to this website

My commit activity for 2025 looks like this:

**Personal Life**

- Got back into playing guitar, and found myself a lovely PRS SE Hollowbody Standard in early summer
- Consistently went to gym 3x/week, until the moving started; love living the strong life, will get back to the weights asap, and cry about lost strength and bodyweight soon
- Bought apartment, sold old apartment, madness ensued, yada yada yada
- Noticed I know more than I thought about tools and using them, happily DIY-ing electricity, plumbing, woodworking etc. - nice!

**Best _ of 2025**

- **Game**: Kingdom Come: Deliverance II
- **Movie**: Ballerina ("Bugonia", and "Dracula: A Love Tale" as close contenders)
- **Series**: Alien: Earth
