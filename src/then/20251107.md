**Writing**: wish I had time for it, but right now, I haven't got any

**Books**: not much time for that either; when I do find the time to read, it's "A Universe from Nothing", or "Leviathan Wakes"

**Games**: probably less than an hour a week currently; started Dorfromantik, Cocoon, CarX Street, and SW Outlaws not long ago, picking up whatever feels most calming

**Work**: big new project, happy to focus on that for most of my time, which is so much better than working on many small projects, and dealing with tons of content switching

**Life**: we managed to sell our old apartment quickly, and for a good price, which is really nice, but has us preparing to move into the new place asap; we already ordered a kitchen, bought some furniture etc. - it's a lot of things to take care of at the same time, but we're trying to take it easy, so we don't get overwhelmed

**Weight Lifting**: the last 5/3/1 cycle was great, and I just finished a deload week; looking forward to getting back to the heavy weights next week; 1,5 years of strength training feel even more helpful and rewarding right now, moving furniture and boxes has never been easier in my life, haha
