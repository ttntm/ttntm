**Writing**: I'd like to work on a larger article about Astro and different headless CMS options, but I had to migrate 2 web applications from Fauna to Supabase instead

**Books**: Dune Messiah, Leviathan Wakes, If Cats Disappeared from the World

**Games**: Kingdome Come: Deliverance II - an amazing game so far!

**Drinks**: Protein shakes, milk, ice tea and the occasional coffee

**Work**: preparing for some Azure certifications, doing too much architecture, trying to refresh my limited C#/.NET/Python knowledge

**Life**: spring is here - bikes are ready, plants were planted, and we also set up a solar powered irrigation system; I also sold an old guitar and bought a new one, an Ibanez AS53-TKF, which will hopefully arrive soon

**Weight Lifting**: GZCLP, cycle II (started on Dec. 28th 2024) - I'm close to the end of the cycle, got to figure out what to do next
