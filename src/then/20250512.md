**Writing**: still haven't started that article about Astro and headless CMS options, maybe I'll finally manage to do it this month

**Books**: Leviathan Wakes, If Cats Disappeared from the World

**Games**: Kingdome Come: Deliverance II

**Work**: doing too much architecture, documentation and other stuff at the moment, not writing a lot of code

**Life**: enjoying spring quite a bit, hoping to get some biking done, playing my new Ibanez guitar

**Weight Lifting**: doing a month of arms specialization after having finished GZCLP cycle II, also thinking about what program to switch to in June
