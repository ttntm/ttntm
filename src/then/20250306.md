**Writing**: working on a larger article about Astro and different headless CMS options, but procrastinating a lot and tinkering with this website instead

**Books**: Dune Messiah, Leviathan Wakes, If Cats Disappeared from the World

**Games**: Stellar Blade (finally!)

**Drinks**: Protein shakes, milk, ice tea and coffee

**Work**: working on a couple of new opportunities where "we need a website..." somehow turned into "we need a web _platform_", also preparing for some certifications, and planning a refresher of my limited C#/.NET knowledge

**Life**: spring is around the corner, so it's time to ready the bike and prepare for more outdoor activity; still haven't figured out holiday plans for this year, but made plans for a few cool day trips (i.e. Bratislava, visits to different spas)

**Weight Lifting**: GZCLP, cycle II (started on Dec. 28th 2024)
