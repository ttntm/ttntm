**Work**: working on a couple of websites, also preparing for some certifications, and planning a refresher of my limited C#/.NET knowledge

**Life**: done with winter, cold, and the flu; watching too many good things right now (i.e. Fringe, Paradise, Severance); trying to figure out holiday plans for this year
