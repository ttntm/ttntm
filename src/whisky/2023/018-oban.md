#### Notes

81,90 at Spar = 61,42 at -25%

Compared to other bottles around at home at the same time:

Lagavulin 8: Strong, lemon-y and extremely peaty/smokey. Nice to drink, should sit in the glass a bit though.

Caol Ila 12: Quite smooth while still peaty. Much less peaty than the above.

Oban 14: the smoothest of these 3, not even a hint of a burn. Also the least peaty in my nose. Could taste the degree of refinement that must've gone into it.

Couldn't decide on a "winner", but leaning towards Lagavulin rn - that one's a wild one.
