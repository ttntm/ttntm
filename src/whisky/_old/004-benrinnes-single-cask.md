#### Notes

Bought it out of pure curiosity.

No added color, non-chill filtered. Distilled on Aug. 19th 2009 and bottled on Jan. 8th 2018, taken out of a cask called "Hogshead". It's not exactly 9 years old, but that's what the label says anyway. Drinking it felt a little special, and I enjoyed it while it lasted.

Taste: quite pleasant from what I can remember. Also, a little spicy.
