Something I noticed trying to get a list of my app's users from Netlify's Identity service.

It's not a big challenge to write the necessary function (see: {% ext "GitHub readme", "https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js#admin-methods" %}), but what it _doesn't_ mention (clearly enough...) is that this admin function needs to be deployed to your site to work.

I struggled for a bit, looking for mistakes that weren't there while receiving 401 authorization errors...

NB: deploy the admin function/s, keep the UI to use them offline and disable the function when not needed anymore (I resorted to renaming it `function.js.bak` just in case I need it again in the future).

**Update Dec. 3rd 2020**: I created a pull request and the readme (see link above) was updated.
