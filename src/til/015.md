I was aware of the existence of the `scroll-behavior` attribute, but I never really used it so far ('thanks' to jQuery, scrolling libs or framework internals handling it themselves).

When added to a site (like this one), it'll make all your anchor-based navigation feel buttery smooth - who wouldn't want that?

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
  /* etc. */
}
```

And that's it. This one line covers everything: from simple "back to top" links to anchor-tag navigation across pages - they'll all be `smooth` now.

PS: you can try how it feels right away; just click on any of the `#`-prefixed anchors in front of the TIL item titles on this page.
