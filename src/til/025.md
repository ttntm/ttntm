URL decode what's displayed in your browser's address bar when viewing the root page of your Teams channel's documents library in SharePoint. We need `channelId` and `groupId`:

```txt
https://your_company-my.sharepoint.com/personal/THIS_IS_YOU/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=/sites/TEAMS_CHANNEL_NAME_FULL/Shared Documents/CHANNEL_NAME&listurl=https://your_company.sharepoint.com/sites/TEAMS_CHANNEL_NAME_FULL/Shared Documents&remoteItem={"mp":{"webAbsoluteUrl":"https://your_company.sharepoint.com/sites/TEAM_NAME","listFullUrl":"https://your_company.sharepoint.com/sites/TEAM_NAME/Shared Documents","rootFolder":"","channelId":"CHANNEL_ID_","groupId":"GROUP_GUID","displayName":"CHANNEL_NAME"},"rsi":{"listFullUrl":"https://your_company.sharepoint.com/sites/TEAMS_CHANNEL_NAME_FULL/Shared Documents","rootFolder":"/sites/TEAMS_CHANNEL_NAME_FULL/Shared Documents/CHANNEL_NAME","webAbsoluteUrl":"https://your_company.sharepoint.com/sites/CHANNEL_NAME_FULL"}}
```

Head to MS Graph Explorer at: {% ext "developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer#", "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer#" %}

Use the endpoint at `/v1.0/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/filesFolder` with the two ids previously obtained from the URL.

*NB: you might have to set some permissions for the request to go through.*

Eventually, the request should lead to a response that contains the `driveId` we were looking for:

```json
"parentReference": {
    "driveId": "b!...yourDriveId",
    "driveType": "documentLibrary"
},
```
