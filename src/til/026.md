My site didn't have anay status for content yet and I felt like unpublishing some older posts. Now (ab)using 'draft' status for that, this is how (in `.eleventy.js`):

```js
const publishedContent = (item) => !item.data.draft

//...

config.addCollection('blog', async (collection) => {
  return collection.getFilteredByGlob('./src/blog/*.md').filter(publishedContent)
})
```
