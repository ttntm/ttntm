My site didn't have any status for content yet and I felt like unpublishing some older posts. 

Filtering a collection based on a front matter `status` attribute was _not_ a good idea - pages were hidden, but their URLs still existed.

I didn't find a good way to handle drafts in actual collections, so they're stored in a dedicated folder _outside_ the site's `./src` directory now.
