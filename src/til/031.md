Use case example: table A contains customers, table B contains coupon codes that haven't been assigned to customers yet.

```sql
SELECT
  CU.Id
  ,CU.EmailAddress
  ,CC.Code AS CouponCode
FROM (
  SELECT
    Id
    ,EmailAddress
    ,row_number() OVER (ORDER BY Id) AS Rn
  FROM Customers
) AS CU
INNER JOIN
(
  SELECT
    Code
    ,row_number() OVER (ORDER BY Code) AS Rn
  FROM CouponCode
  WHERE CustomerId IS NULL OR CustomerId = ''
) AS CC
ON CU.Rn = CC.Rn
```
