Use case: customers that bought items from a range of products in one or more orders in the last 90 days.

Example data:

```bash
OrderId | Email | ProductId
123 | bob@xmpl.com | A1
123 | bob@xmpl.com | B4
456 | bob@xmpl.com | E1
```

We want the email address `bob@xmpl.com` to appear only once in our query results. All other data is irrelevant, because we already know that every row in the source table qualifies for the above criteria based on a previous query.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT
    Email
    , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Email ORDER BY OrderId DESC) rn
  FROM xmpl
) AS tmp
WHERE tmp.rn = 1
```
