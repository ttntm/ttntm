Sensible default config that returns an A+ in Mozilla Observatory:

```yaml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; img-src *; frame-ancestors 'none'"
    Referrer-Policy = "same-origin"
    Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
```

_NB: adjust CSP as necessary when working on sites that actually load scripts._
