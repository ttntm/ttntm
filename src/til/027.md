An SWA last deployed in late August 2022 showed the message "Function host is not running." after a recent deployment.

Local testing with Azure's {% ext "SWA CLI" "https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli/" %} also showed errors. Further investigation showed that the "Minimum extension version" in `host.json` had to be changed:

```json
"extensionBundle": {
  "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
  "version": "[2.*, 3.0.0)"
}
```

Reason: EOL for extended support of the runtime version for functions on December 13, 2022.
