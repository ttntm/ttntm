Using things like `Buffer.from()` in a Cloudflare Worker will result in an `undefined` error.

To make it work, the `nodejs_compat` flag has to be enabled in the worker configuration file (in the `compatibility_flags` array). When that's done, `Buffer` can be used:

```js
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer'

globalThis.Buffer = Buffer

// rest of the code
```
