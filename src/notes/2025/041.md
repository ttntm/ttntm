By default, APIs (=functions) added to Azure Static Web Apps don't offer logging.

Application Insights can be added to them, taking care of that:

1. Create an Application Insights resource for the SWA
2. When created, copy its `Instrumentation Key`
3. In the SWA config, add `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` as an environment variable and paste the value copied in step #2
