When your pipeline succeeds, but your function/s simply won't appear, check the following:

- Deployment package must be _the whole project directory_, not just the `/dist` folder
- Manually syncing triggers might be necessary; include a quick bash script using `curl` (docs: {% ext "Trigger syncing", "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies?tabs=linux#trigger-syncing" %})
