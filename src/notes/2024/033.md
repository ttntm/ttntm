Use case: building a custom filter based on arbitrary property of the items in the collection.

The syntax is a bit clunky, but this works:

```html
{% raw %}{% customFilter collections.whisky, "region", "status", "wanted" %}{% endraw %}
```

...and can be used in a shortcode to render something:

```js
customFilter: function(collection, filterKey, excludeKey = null, excludeValue = null) {
  const terms = collection.reduce((map, currentItem) => {
    // some reducing of a collection into a map-like object
  }, {})

  return Object.keys(terms)
    .sort()
    .map((t) => {
      return `<li>${t}</li>`
    })
    .join('')
```

The first code snippet above shows the input collection, the property to use for the filter (`region`) and another property (`status`) that's used to exclude collection items where `status == wanted`.

This works rather well so far - it was inspired by the comments in {% ext "eleventy/issues/813", "https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/813" %} and {% ext "eleventy/issues/1818", "https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1818" %}.
