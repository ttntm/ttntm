Maybe I'm lazy, but I didn't really feel like implementing proper pagination for DB query results that hardly ever reach the 2 digit KB numbers.

To make sure you'll get all the queried DB rows in the response, Faunas's `Paginate()` function needs a `size` parameter:

```js
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
  // init stuff
  return client.query(q.Paginate(q.Match(q.Index('indexName'), 'term'), { size: 500 }))
    .then((response) => {
      // the rest of your code
    }).catch((error) => {
      // the rest of your code
    })
}
```

Keep in mind that you'll only get 64 results if this parameter is not specified!
