title: "Vue: 'Array.push()' used in Vuex mutation not triggering 'watch()'"

I was doing this in Vuex:

```js
ADD_RECIPE_USER(state, value) {
  state.userRecipes.push(value)
}
```

It was working fine, but a `watch()` effect used in a Vue component didn't catch the update while going back and forth between routes made the updated data appear as if it was always there.

After adding a bunch of cheap `console.log()` 'breakpoints', I eventually got to the bottom of it and changed my code to this:

```js
ADD_RECIPE_USER(state, value) {
  state.userRecipes = [...state.userRecipes, value]
}
```

Conclusion: `watch()` paired with Vuex getters seems to require the `state.key = newValue` assignment.

Seems a bit weird, but might have been mentioned in the docs somewhere.
