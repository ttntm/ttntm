Got this error when trying to use `sftp` in a Linux terminal.

Resolution:

Edit `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, add those lines:

```bash
HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
```

_NB: might break some other stuff (GitLab in my case), so be careful and remember you added those line._
