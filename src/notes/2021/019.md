title: "Windows 10: process 'System' causing constant high disk activity"

**Symptoms**:

  - Fresh Windows 10 installation on a new device (build 19043)
  - Drive C:\ BitLocker encryted
  - Drive D:\ not encrypted but on the same hardware as drive C:\ (Intel SSD)
  - Constant disk activity of > 50% by "System" process, starting right after boot
  - Read/write to `HardDiskVolume4` (D:\ in my case)

**Resolution**:

Turned on BitLocker for drive D:\ as well.

No more constant high disk activity after reboots, system feels more responsive in general.

_NB: found this when systematically stopping running services due to the lack of a better approach._
