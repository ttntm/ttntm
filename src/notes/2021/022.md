Recently got my work notebook's user profile changed to a different one. WSL was still installed and working, but didn't recognize my Manjaro installation anymore (despite of it being in the exact same physical location on a separate non-OS partition)

This is what I did to get it running again:

1. Set WSL2 as default: `wsl --set-default-version 2` (this is _crucial_)
2. Install a clean new instance
3. Make sure it's installed properly, then run `wsl â€”shutdown`
4. Remove the newly created vhdx file and replace with your old one
5. Run something like `Manjaro.exe config --default-user <username>` to make your previous user the default user
6. Set Windows Terminal as WSL's default: `{InstanceName}.exe config --default-term wt`
7. Restore your WT settings (i.e. from your old user profile, a path like `C:\Users\user.name\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_123xyz\LocalState`)

_NB: really pleasant surprise to find everything just as I'd left it after having figured out to above steps :)_
