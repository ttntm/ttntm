I needed to format a date from `new Date()` recently and using any libs (like _date-fns_ or _moment.js_) and was not an option; doing that would have been overkill for the small project I was working on.

After a bit of research, I came across the `Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString` method and implemented it like this:

```js
const getDate = () => {
  let date = new Date();

  let dateOptions = {
    weekday: 'long',
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'long',
    day: 'numeric'
  };

  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', dateOptions);
}
```

**Result**: _Tuesday, April 13, 2021_
