Had to look this up today, here's how to do it.

First install a Vite plugin:

`npm install -D @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl`

Then use it in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import basicSsl from '@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl'

export default {
  plugins: [
    basicSsl()
  ]
}
```

_NB: works with Astro too, simply create the Vite config file in case it's not there yet._
