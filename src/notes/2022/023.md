I don't tolerate spyware, no matter where it comes from. Here's what you can do if you're on Windows and got S1 forced into your browser/s:

1. Open `regedit`
2. Navigate to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\[Vendor]\[Browser]`
3. Get rid of whatever keys you find in `ExtensionInstallForcelist`
4. Close your browser/s
5. Clean out your user profile's extensions folder:
  Edge: `[LocalUserProfile]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\[EdgeProfile]\Extensions\[S1ExtensionID]\`
  Firefox: `[LocalUserProfile]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[FFProfile]\extensions\sentinelone_visibility@sentinelone.com.xpi`

_NB: survives reboots, will have to see whether or not those policies are ever getting reapplied._
