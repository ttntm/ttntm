I distinctly remember the day I played GTA III for the first time. It was amazing, and hardly any other game that was around at the time offered that degree of realism, both in terms of actual gameplay, and crime spree/rampage simulation.

Yes, I was much too young for the game, and I spent hours ignoring the story. But I had tons of fun blowing shit up, working as a taxi driver, collecting cool cars, and exploring the city - and that was just great.

I only started appreciating various GTA storylines much later, especially when playing Vice City and San Andreas. And if it wasn't for the social aspect of playing GTA III together with friends (i.e. "you get one respawn, make it count, and then we switch places..."), San Andreas would be my "best in series" choice.
