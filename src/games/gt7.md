Ignoring Gran Turismo Sport, GT7 was my first actual Gran Turismo game.

The release coincided with my birthday, and I bought at release. I come back to the game regularly, whenever I feel like racing or when an update adds a car I really like. Customizing a car and figuring out a good tune are some aspects of the game I enjoy very much, sometimes even more than racing.

There's a stunning photo mode too, if you're into that kind of thing - the results are often great and sometimes even wallpaper material: [EX1](/img/games/gt7-ex1.jpg), [EX2](/img/games/gt7-ex2.jpg)

It's also quite amazing that the game still receives regular - free! - content updates.
