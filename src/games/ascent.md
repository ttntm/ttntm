An isometric ARPG set in a cyberpunk world. I loved it so much I even got the platinum trophy.

The gameplay was fantastic, itemization, story and characters were cool too. What really stood out was the world the story took place in, the way it looked and felt alive, dirty and like a convincing cyberpunk dystopia.
