I love cyberpunk stories and this one was a good one.

The game itself definitely wasn't matching all the promises made before release, but the version I played on the PS5 in 2022 (after checking out the free demo first...) was good enough for what turned out to be a truly wild ride into the world of cyberpunk and the neon lights of Night City.

I also enjoyed 2.0 and the DLC, which re-designed many of the game's core systems (i.e. cyberware, weapons), and offers a pretty cool new storyline.
