Pretty much the same story as "Age of Empires" and "Anno 1602": hooked as soon as I touched it.

The turn-based system was a nice change, but turns took longer the larger my empire grew. This made "just one more turn..." increasingly more time-consuming, and I remember many short nights as a result of that.
