The first Fallout I played, and also my favorite game in the whole series.

I remember picking up the box, and installing the game: I was hooked immediately, loved the setting, and enjoyed FO2 for 5 or more playthroughs (the last one in 2011).

Characters, locations, the story and the dialogues left me with unforgettable memories, and provided tons of inspiration for anything post-apocalyptic (like homebrew TTRPG campaigns).
