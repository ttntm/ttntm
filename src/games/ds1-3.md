Getting into Dark Souls I took me 3 attempts over 6 months back in 2013. But when it finally clicked, it clicked for good.

The difficulty aside, From Software is extremely skilled at building a world full of mysterious, interesting stories for those that go looking for it. Sure, you could also just blaze through the game, enjoy the fights and move on. But for me, the true depth of both DS I and III was found in the cryptic lore and the NPCs storylines. Coop and PVP were fun too.

"What about Dark Souls II?", one might ask. Well, I played it about halfway through and stopped. It just wasn't for me and I doubt I'll ever try again.
