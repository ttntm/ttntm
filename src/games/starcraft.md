I first played StarCraft at a friends place, and walked home with a "backup copy" later that day.

What followed were weeks of constructing additional pylons, charging the Yamato cannon, and trying my best at rushing things with Zerglings.

Definitely one of the timelessly great games of the RTS genre, and also my second favorite Blizzard series after Diablo (I never cared much for WarCraft).
