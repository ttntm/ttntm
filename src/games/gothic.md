I played this game soon after its release, and long before it became a "cult classic".

Gothic offered a unique open world to immerse yourself in, a cool story and combat/loot that felt really rewarding. It was also full of bugs that were sometimes frustrating, but often hilarious.

I quite fondly remember many long gaming sessions and phone calls with friends, trying to collectively figure out quests and workarounds for bugs/glitches.
