A truly outstanding game, full of decisions, consequences, death, fire, and heresy.

My playthrough was naively good, and mostly iconoclastic at first, but the events that transpired about halfway through the game definitely changed how my character handled things and how I handled the remaining decision (mostly dogmatic).

One of my favorite moments: talking to an imperial clerk and allowing him to complete his inventory of the player character (i.e. agreeing to get naked and be fully catalogued). Doing that unlocked a decent special item, and an achievement, haha.

Reaching the end of the game took me a while, but I was satisfied with the "good" (but grimdark...) ending I got.
