The base game was originally released for PS3 in 2012; I played its re-release including the "Dark Arisen" expansion on PS4 in late 2020/early 2021.

Definitely on the weirder end of ARPGs, but quite a "hidden gem" in terms of gameplay depth, build/character customization and its unique world. Bonus points to the endgame/expansion area which was at times reminiscent of things that From Software did/does.

Recommended for ARPG fans that don't necessarily need a strong story.
