This was one of the first games I got completely lost in, especially during holidays.

The core gameplay is a wonderful mix of exploration, resource management and city building, with some occasional diplomacy and conflicts.

Someone else once labelled this one "relaxing, rewarding and highly addictive", and I couldn't agree more.
