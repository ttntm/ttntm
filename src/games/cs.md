Much like the Diablo series, CS has been a game that I regularly came back to. LAN parties, matches at home with my brother, and also online multiplayer made sure that it never got boring enough to quit for good.

The last CS I played was CS:GO, which was also the last time I played any video game (more or less) competitively. My obsession with CS:GO reached its peak during the summer of 2014, and I even watched e-sports matches - the first and only time in my life that I spent my time watching others play a video game...

I don't think that I ever was pro-level good, or even close to that, but I definitely had some glorious runs. And if I still had a gaming PC, I'd probably still play CS occasionally.
