I knew I wanted to give this one a shot when I first saw the box. It took a couple of years though, and I ended up getting it from some "games at a discount" series that was around back then.

I think it took about 2 or 3 restarts until I got it right, but it turned out to be a very rewarding game. The turn-based combat kept things interesting and made it feel more manageable than similar tactical RTS games (i.e. "Commandos" which was around at the same time). I also liked how you could combine items to make new ones, like DIY barrel extenders for your guns.
