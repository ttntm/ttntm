The 2nd game I played on my PS5 after getting one in June 2021.

A thrilling (and challenging) game with a mysterious story that has to be uncovered and put together from various pieces. It's a polished game with wonderfully smooth gameplay, super precise controls and a great sound design.

I can absolutely recommend playing it, but it's a roguelike with bullet hell elements, which might not be the best choice for everyone.
