The 2nd game I played on my PS5 after getting one in June 2021.

A thrilling (and challenging) game with a mysterious story that has to be uncovered and put together from various pieces. It's a polished game with wonderfully smooth gameplay, super precise controls and a great sound design. I can absolutely recommend playing it, but please keep in mind that it's (more or less) a roguelike with bullet hell elements.
