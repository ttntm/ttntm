To me, the Diablo games rank like this (best > rest):
*D2 > D1 > D3 > D4*

Diablo II has the most significance to me based on time spent and memories made. Playing in a LAN during long summer vacation/s, unpatched corpse explosions, the rush of online boss runs on a crappy internet connection, collecting ears, rune words etc. - it's probably lots of nostalgia, but no other Diablo ever came quite close to D2 for me.

A longer essay about D2/D2R can be found in {% ext "issue 17 of Ctrl-ZINE", "https://ctrl-c.club/~singletona082/zine/2024/Ctrl-ZINE.Issue.17.pdf" %}.
