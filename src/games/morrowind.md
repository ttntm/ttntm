A great game, one of the first I ever played that truly made its open world feel alive. Over the years, I think I must've started 20 or more different characters, most of them never even getting started with the main story.

I also remember the graphics, and especially the water, being a highlight that I often used to show off my GeForce 3 Ti500.
