Really liked this one. Felt like the games of the past that got me into gaming in the first place.

A complete package, mission based gameplay instead of an - empty - "open world", no forced online multiplayer stuff, no bugs and no cash grab microtransactions. It was a little challenging at times, but always felt rewarding.

I had a truly great time with it and will probably pick it up again whenever I feel like it.
