I still remember the day I first touched this game: a classmate got it as a birthday gift, and we were glued to the screen immediately.

Every part of the core gameplay loop made sense, and both the campaign and the scenarios provided fun for many hours.

I don't remember how many of my father's old company laptops this masterpiece was installed on during family holidays, but it must have been a few.
