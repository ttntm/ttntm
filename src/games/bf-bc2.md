Not my first Battlefield game, and neither my last. But the only one I took _really_ seriously in terms of online multiplayer.

I don't know how it happened, but I got very addicted to the chaotic carnage this game offered. The destructible buildings/environment was a big part of it, because it offered a new approach to deal with campers (that could turn BF2's multiplayer matches into) and forced the attacking time to stay on the move.

Many hours later, I believe I reached the "git gud" stage - I distinctly remember a couple of matches that I effectively soloed, rushing past enemy lines and making their lives miserable with my trusty AN-94 Abakan.
