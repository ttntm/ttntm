I loved reading "Roadside Picnic" and enjoyed the Tarkovsky movie. Getting the game felt like a logical next step.

I remember it as being truly immersive, thrilling and really scary at times (i.e. "meeting" the first Controller mutant), which definitely left me with a lot of memories of making my way through it as the Marked One.

Overall a game with outstanding atmosphere and a setting I really enjoyed - give it a shot if you can and if "FPS with RPG and survival horror elements" sounds good to you.
