A very cool turn-based cyberpunk/sci-fi adventure, with a couple of RPG elements.

The story takes place on a space station, and actions per day (= turn) are limited. Skill rolls are a combination of a bonus/penalty (starting class/skill points) and 1d6. This system, paired with the interesting story, makes the game highly addictive - "just one more day..." to find out what happens.

At the time of writing this, I reached one ending with one character - it took me about 5h to get there, and I'll definitely spend some more time with this gem.
