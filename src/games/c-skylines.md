One of the rare gems that I completely got lost in. Played both the PC and the PS4 versions; the PC version wins, because there are mods that change both gameplay (i.e. traffic) and visuals (i.e. user created assets like buildings).

Early (unmodded/vanilla) cities were fun, but what I really discovered as "my thing" was building smaller, highly customized towns that were close/r to reality and (mostly) built using individually placed buildings instead of the vanilla game's autopopulated zones.

It's definitely a time-consuming game, can be tedious too (trafficâ€¦), but building [a somewhat realistic looking city](/img/CS_Screenshot.jpg) and looking at it from above felt rewarding to me.
