I had this game on my wishlist for a long time. When I finally picked it up, I felt a bit stupid, because I absolutely fell in love with this game after a couple of hours.

KC:D takes place in medieval Bohemia, offering a truly immersive world. There's no magic, no dragons and no fantasy stuff - the "real" world is challenging enough. Combat feels dangerous, stealth is thrilling, and the virtual world feels alive, reacting to your character's actions and choices.

Browsing through this list, loving KC:D doesn't surprise me: you could think of it as a medieval sibling of "Cyberpunk 2077", with influences from classic Piranha Bytes (i.e. "Gothic") and TES games.
