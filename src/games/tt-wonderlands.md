Bought this 2nd hand in late December 2023 and haven't had that much fun with a game in long time!

The premise is a game of <s>Dungeons & Dragons</s> Bunkers & Badasses set in a medieval fantasy world with guns and explosions. Sounds a bit silly, but it's the proven Borderlands formula mixed with RPG elements (classes, stats, skill trees), and it works _really_ well.
