&#128075; Hi there, I'm Tom, a software engineer from Austria.
You can find out a bit more about me [here](/about/).

## How to Contact Me

Here's **how I prefer to keep in touch**, and why:

- My favored way to communicate is [via email](mailto:ttntm@pm.me); it's the fastest/fairest way for me to respond to people
- If you have my phone number: use Signal, and please don't call; I generally dislike phone calls, especially ones that I don't expect
- I write about what I am doing on this website, and usually share links elsewhere
- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ttntm) is my only social media, please follow me there
- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ttntm) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ttntm) for my public projects

You _won't_ find me using:

- Any Meta products like FB, Instagram or WhatsApp
- Dev&period;to; I used to syndicate my articles there, but the site's full of bot accounts these days
- LinkedIn
- Twitter, or whatever it's called when you read this

The idea for this page came from {% ext "Alastair Johnson", "https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/" %}.
