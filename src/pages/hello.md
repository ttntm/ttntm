<span class="d-block large mb2">&#128075; Hi there, nice to meet you!</span>

Here's **how I prefer to keep in touch**, and why:

- My favored way to communicate is [via email](mailto:ttntm@pm.me); it's the fastest/fairest way for me to respond to people
- If you have my phone number: use Signal, and please don't call; I generally dislike phone calls, especially ones that I don't expect
- I write about what I am doing on this website, and usually share links elsewhere
- {% ext "Mastodon", "https://hachyderm.io/@ttntm" %} is my only social media, you can follow me there
- My public projects are available at {% ext "Codeberg", "https://codeberg.org/ttntm" %} and {% ext "GitHub", "https://github.com/ttntm" %}

Identity claims and verification: {% ext "7DQAYHLWT6J6555DZFNBLP3IZI", "https://keyoxide.org/aspe:keyoxide.org:7DQAYHLWT6J6555DZFNBLP3IZI" %}

{% include "components/contact.pgp.njk" %}

You _won't_ find me using:

- Any Meta products like FB, Instagram or WhatsApp
- Dev&period;to; I used to syndicate my articles there, but the site's full of bot accounts these days
- LinkedIn
- Twitter, or whatever it's called when you read this
