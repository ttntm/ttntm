A list of the things I'm interested in and a constant work in progress that will grow over time.

## Tech and Web Stuff

A couple of the web and tech topics that I'm most interested in.

### Building Your Own Tools

Building and growing your own tools is something I really enjoy. Anything from web applications to libraries and scripts really.

### Personal Websites

I love discovering people's websites and finding out more about them.

### Privacy

I try to stay informed and put best practices into action wherever possible.

### Software Architecture

A recent interest, and to some extent an increasingly important necessity for my job.

I enjoy digging into this vast topic, and I'm (re-) learning many things about building (sometimes distributed) systems and applications.

### The Old Internet

This one's about (re-) discovering what made the web such a great place so many years ago, getting nostalgic over web directories, blinking buttons and handmade websites far away from algorithm-driven doom-feeds.

It also led to me growing and maintaining the {% ext "BUKMARK.CLUB", "https://bukmark.club" %}, a new web directory listing websites that provide a curated collection of bookmarks and/or links to other websites.

## Video Games

I grew up playing video games and I still love playing them. In 2015, I switched from PC to the PlayStation as my primary platform, and I'm really happy there.

Some of my favorite games can be found listed on my [Game Recommendations](/games/) page.

## Music

Music used to be an important part of my life for many years, but it's moved to a much less involved and rather passive role these days. I played the guitar in various underground bands, and I sometimes still do, but that's mostly just motivated by nostalgia.

I also own a decent record collection that consists of CDs, MCs and vinyl records, which is something I really treasure and make good use of.

The musical genres I enjoy the most are:

- Black and Death Metal (mostly old school)
- Hard Rock and (Heavy) Metal
- Synth- and Retrowave

## Food and Drinks

I really love cooking, and I've been interested in trying out new recipes since my late teenage years. Thankfully, that's a family thing and my wife loves it too. So much so, that we ended up building (and maintaining) our own {% ext "open source recipes collection", "https://recept0r.com" %} a couple of years ago.

If I had to pick just one favorite food, it'd have to be pizza. I simply love making and eating that!

### Whisky

Focusing on Scotch Whisky is a rather recent interest, but one I really enjoy. You can find out more about this interest on my [Whisky page](/whisky/).

## The Rest

These might turn into more detailed sections over time:

- Board games and TTRPGs
- Car culture and customization/tuning (mostly the visual aspect)
- Cycling and Bicycle maintenance
- Gardening, hiking and nature
- Home improvements and DIY
- Reading and learning about (new) things
