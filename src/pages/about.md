      Hi, I'm Tom.

    <p class="p-note m0">
      I'm <s>a software engineer</s> <em>not-a-fan-of-titles</em> with many years of experience in both professional and freelance software development. My expertise lies in web development, with a clear focus on the front end. However, years of working with enterprise systems and workflow automation have taught me <em>a lot</em> about backend development. Besides, I'm an advocate of free and open source software and a Linux user (Fedora, Manjaro).

I grew up with the internet, building my first websites around 2002 when frames and `marquee` tags were still state of the art and my code got hacked into text editors without syntax highlighting. We were taught some C, JavaScript and Pascal in school back then, which helped shape a solid understanding of ways to make computers do what I want them to do, long before higher education.

My professional career in IT started in 2008, and I worked for telecom and IT service providers, software development companies and freelance clients since then. As of 2021, I'm working as a software engineer at an agency that delivers custom solutions and tailors standard software to client needs. I'm also volunteering for {% ext "epicenter.works", "https://epicenter.works" %} whenever I can support their activities with my skillset.

When I'm not in front of a screen working, <a href="https://watch3r.app" target="_blank">watching movies</a> or [playing videogames](/games/), I enjoy spending time with my family, parenting a lovely [Persian cat](#cat) and being outside (cycling, gardening, hiking). I also like playing boardgames with friends and working on DIY projects. Oh, and I really love cooking - just head over to <a href="https://recept0r.com" target="_blank">recept0r</a> if you're curious.
