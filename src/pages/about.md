      Hi, I'm Tom.
    </h2>
    <p class="p-note m0">
      I'm a software engineer with many years of experience in both professional and freelance software development. I specialize in web development, specifically focusing on the front end. And due to years of experience in enterprise systems and workflow automation, I've gained extensive knowledge in backend development as well.

I grew up with the internet, building my first websites around 2002 when frames and `marquee` tags were still state of the art and my code got hacked into text editors without syntax highlighting. We were taught some C, JavaScript and Pascal in school back then, which helped shape a solid understanding for ways to make computers do what I want them to do.

My professional career in IT started a couple of years later, and I worked for telecom and IT service providers, software development companies and freelance clients since then. As of 2021, I'm working as a software engineer at an agency that delivers custom solutions and tailors standard software to client needs. I'm also volunteering for {% ext "epicenter.works", "https://epicenter.works" %} whenever I can support their activities with my skill set.

I'm interested in a lot of things, and you can read all about that on my <a href="/interests/">/interests page</a>.
In short: when I'm not in front of a screen working, watching movies or playing video games, I enjoy spending time with my family, parenting a lovely [Persian cat](#cat) and being outside (cycling, gardening, hiking). I also play board games with friends occasionally and enjoy working on DIY projects. Oh, and I really love cooking!
