## Hardware

I use an immortal Dell Precision M3800 from 2013 running Manjaro for private stuff and a company owned Lenovo ThinkPad P14s Gen 3 running Fedora for work. At the office, the ThinkPad's connected to 2 ThinkVision P27h-20 27" monitors, and I'm using both my trusty old SteelSeries 6Gv2 mechanical keyboard and my Razer DeathAdder (RZ01-0015) wired mouse. When I'm working from home, I don't use an external keyboard or monitor. I'm also frequently using a set of Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 and a 4 TB Seagate external hard drive.

My current phone's a Pixel 4a 5G that I got in 03/2021 when my wife inherited my LG G7 ThinQ after her beloved Sony phone died. The Pixel's a great phone and I got so used to gesture navigation that using other phones feels somehow off now. My work phone is a refurbished iPhone Xs that does what it needs to do (mostly emails, MFA and Teams) rather well.

### Entertainment/Gaming

I play my video games on a PlayStation 5 (disk edition, capable of DVD/Blu-ray playback) that's connected to a 58" Samsung Q60T. There's also a Minisforum (mini-) PC connected to the TV that we're using as a media center.

### Listening to Music

I don't use any music streaming services. It's either local files via {% ext "cmus", "https://cmus.github.io" %} (my own CD/Vinyl rips collected over the years) or actual records played on my Audio Technica AT-LP120XBT-USB. The turntable's Bluetooth connection is super convenient: it lets me listen to music my wife would get a headache from without disturbing her at all.

### Making Music

I started playing guitar a long time ago, and I still do. [I owned many guitars](/blog/six-string-memories/), and I'm currently using an Ibanez AS53. Itâ€™s my first hollow body guitar, and I'm really happy with it - I pick it up and play whenever I feel like it, without the need for an amplifier.

The gear I'm currently using is limited to a Boss Katana Mini and an Orange Crush Mini, as well as a Two Notes Le Crunch tube preamp (that can be used as a pedal amp - very convenient!). I've also got a couple of effect pedals in a box (an old HM-2, a random Chinese OD pedal, and a Tube Screamer I built from a kit), but I'm hardly using them these days.

## Software

My terminal emulator is {% ext "WezTerm", "https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/" %} running Zsh with {% ext "Oh My Zsh", "https://ohmyz.sh" %} and {% ext "Powerlevel10k", "https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k" %}. Code OSS (= VS Code) with the {% ext "GitLab Mono", "https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/frontend/fonts/" %} typeface and the {% ext "Kanagawa", "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qufiwefefwoyn.kanagawa" %} theme is my primary editor. I also use {% ext "Neovim", "https://neovim.io" %} or {% ext "micro" "https://micro-editor.github.io" %} whenever I need to edit files in a terminal and {% ext "gedit", "https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit" %} as a scratchpad.

The **VS Code extensions** I use the most are:

- {% ext "GitLess", "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maattdd.gitless" %}
- {% ext "Live Preview", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-vscode/live-server" %}
- {% ext "LTeX", "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neo-ltex.ltex" %}
- {% ext "Surround", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/yatki/vscode-surround" %}

...there's a bunch of others too, like "XYZ language support" or "XYZ IntelliSense", but they're not really going to be of much interest to anyone.

**VS Code Theme History**

- {% ext "Nord Deep", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/marlosirapuan/nord-deep" %}
- {% ext "Tokyo City", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/huytd/tokyo-city" %}
- {% ext "Tokyo Night", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/enkia/tokyo-night" %}
- {% ext "Plastic", "https://plastictheme.com/themes/vscode" %}
- {% ext "Nord", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/arcticicestudio/nord-visual-studio-code" %}

I'm using {% ext "Zen Browser", "https://zen-browser.app" %} and Ungoogled Chromium as browsers currently. All my browsers use DuckDuckGo as search engine and {% ext "my custom browser homepage", "https://github.com/ttntm/startpage" %} to have everything important right at my fingertips. I use Zen as my main browser and my extensions are pretty basic:

- Proton Pass
- uBlock Origin

Plain text files are what I'm currently using for notes, and Proton takes care of my calendar and emails. When I need to edit pixels, I'm using GIMP, or Photopea, and when I have to work with vectors, I'm using Figma, or Inkscape. I use {% ext "Qi Reader", "https://www.qireader.com" %} for RSS feeds, {% ext "Raindrop.io", "https://raindrop.io" %} is my read-it-later solution, and I publish the most recent items added to my reading list [on this website](/reading).

Finally, there's a bunch of smaller yet extremely convenient tools that I use almost every day: Proton Pass for password management, {% ext "aitrack.work", "https://aitrack.work" %} for time tracking, Proton VPN when I need a VPN and of course {% ext "TKB", "https://kb.ttntm.me" %}, my personal knowledge base.

### Weight Lifting

I started with spreadsheets, but I've since moved to {% ext "Liftosaur", "https://github.com/astashov/liftosaur" %}. It's an open source app with a special syntax to define weightlifting programs, perfectly suited for users that prefer writing code/text over convoluted UIs.
