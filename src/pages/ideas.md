This is a public list of my ideas for future projects. [Email me](mailto:ttntm@pm.me?subject=Ideas) with feedback or if you feel like we could work together and make any of these happen.

**Last updated:** March 18th 2024

- An Eleventy plugin to show the activity in the respective site's repository
- A minimal bookmark manager
- A reboot reminder bot for ActivityPub/Mastodon
- A browser game that works on a Q/A basis; user submitted question/answer combinations, 1 question per calendar day
- An offline version / desktop app for recpt0r; should use a local DB
- A "bring your own API keys" desktop / mobile version for watch3r; should use a local DB
