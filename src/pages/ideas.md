This is a public list of my ideas for future projects. Additional features and improvements for my existing projects and websites are also listed here.

You're always welcome to [contact me](/hello/) with feedback, or if you feel like we could work together and make any of these happen.

- A minimal bookmark manager
- A browser game that works on a Q/A basis; user submitted question/answer combinations, 1 question per calendar day
- An offline version / desktop app for recept0r; should use a local DB
- A "bring your own API keys" desktop / mobile version for watch3r; should use a local DB
- A web graveyard for abandoned, unfinished or otherwise interrupted side projects
- An Eleventy plugin that creates a `robots.txt` file based on the Dark Visitors API
    - An {% ext "eleventy-plugin-robotstxt", "https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/eleventy-plugin-robotstxt" %} exists already, it would just need to use the data from DV
