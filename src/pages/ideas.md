This is a public list of my ideas for future projects. Additional features and improvements for my existing projects and websites are also listed here.

You're always welcome to [email me](mailto:ttntm@pm.me?subject=Ideas) with feedback, or if you feel like we could work together and make any of these happen.

**Last updated:** March 23rd 2024

- An Eleventy plugin to show the commit activity in the respective site's repository
  - It exists already: see section "Custom Data" at {% ext "postgraph.rknight.me", "https://postgraph.rknight.me" %}
  - Refined idea: build such a custom data object from a repository's git history (via JSON, see {% ext "Easily Convert git log Output to JSON", "https://blog.kellybrazil.com/2022/05/17/easily-convert-git-log-output-to-json/" %})
- A minimal bookmark manager
- A reboot reminder bot for ActivityPub/Mastodon
- A browser game that works on a Q/A basis; user submitted question/answer combinations, 1 question per calendar day
- An offline version / desktop app for recept0r; should use a local DB
- A "bring your own API keys" desktop / mobile version for watch3r; should use a local DB
