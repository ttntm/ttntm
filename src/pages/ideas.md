This is a public list of my ideas for future projects. Additional features and improvements for my existing projects and websites are also listed here.

You're always welcome to [contact me](/hello/) with feedback, or if you feel like we could work together and make any of these happen.

- A browser game that works on a Q/A basis; user submitted question/answer combinations, 1 question per calendar day
- An offline version / desktop app for recept0r; should use a local DB
- A "bring your own API keys" desktop / mobile version for watch3r; should use a local DB
- A web graveyard for abandoned, unfinished or otherwise interrupted side projects
- An Eleventy plugin that creates a `robots.txt` file based on the Dark Visitors API
    - An {% ext "eleventy-plugin-robotstxt", "https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/eleventy-plugin-robotstxt" %} exists already, it would just need to use the data from DV

## Done

- A reboot reminder bot for ActivityPub/Mastodon
- Showing the git activity in this website's repository
    - Added 03/24, see [/changelog](/changelog/#timeline)
- Add a sitemap to this website to make it more user-friendly for humans
    - Added 03/24, see [/sitemap](/sitemap/)
- An interface for Eleventy to retrieve reading list data from an API
    - Added 03/24, see [/reading](/reading/)

## Obsolete

- A minimal bookmark manager
  - {% ext "Raindrop.io", "https://raindrop.io" %} is just too good
