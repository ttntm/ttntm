**Writing**: wish I had time or motivation for it, but right now, I don't

**Books**: the occasional guitar book, and continuing "A Universe from Nothing", or "Leviathan Wakes"

**Games**: almost done with Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader

**Work**: still working on "big new project", which is slowly coming to an end

**Life**: mentally preparing for spring and gardening, reading up on related topics, and finishing some other things like tiling the back wall of our kitchen, adding wall shelves to places, hanging pictures, etc.

**Weight Lifting**: Madcow 5x5 is going well, bench is getting noticeably stronger since I switched to doing it with a proper arch, and in the rack with safety pins (so I can _really_ push it without making it deadly)
