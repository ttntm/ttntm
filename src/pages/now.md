**Writing**: wish I had time for it, but right now, I haven't got any

**Books**: not much time for that either; when I do find the time to read, it's "A Universe from Nothing", or "Leviathan Wakes"

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: started playing Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader some weeks ago - I'm loving it, and it's the best CRPG I played in a very long time

**Work**: no major news - still on "big new project", which I'm happily focusing on

**Life**: only 10 more days until we get the kitchen for our new place, so we can probably move in soon; about 3 weeks of time off from work starting Dec. 19th will definitely help with that

**Weight Lifting**: took a break, and spent my gym time assembling furniture etc. - hoping to get back to the weights soon, probably next week
