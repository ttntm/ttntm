**Writing**: trying to find more time to write - some drafts are almost ready, i.e. stuff about cool projects I recently worked on, or the recent switch to a new read-it-later setup

**Books**: Dune Messiah, Leviathan Wakes, If Cats Disappeared from the World

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: The Outer Worlds

**Drinks**: Protein shakes, milk, ice tea

**Work**: working on a couple of websites, also preparing for some certifications, and planning a refresher of my limited C#/.NET knowledge

**Life**: done with winter, cold, and the flu; watching too many good things right now (i.e. Fringe, Paradise, Severance); trying to figure out holiday plans for this year

**Weight Lifting**: GZCLP, cycle II (started on Dec. 28th 2024)
