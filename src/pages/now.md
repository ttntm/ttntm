**Writing**: planning to write a "12 months of lifting weights" recap rather soon, preparing a "7 year website anniversary" post, and still want to write that Astro/CMS thing that I keep procrastinating

**Books**: A Universe from Nothing, Leviathan Wakes, some book about cults

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (almost done), Star Wars Outlaws after that

**Work**: managed to reduce my involvement in not-a-project-yet work, which feels good; code:prose is still about 40:60 at the moment, but things should get better until autumn

**Life**: ~~summer~~ climate change is here, and it's _really_ hot; too hot for most things, but we're going to make good use of our SUP and explore some more of the lakes in our area; also bought another guitar, which means I'm going to sell the Ibanez I bought 3 months ago

**Weight Lifting**: ended up with 5/3/1 eventually and finished the first 3-week cycle last week - tons of volume on the big compound lifts, which seems to be exactly what I need at this point; I'm recovering really well, and I feel strong/er
