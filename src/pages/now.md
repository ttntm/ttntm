**Writing**: wish I had time for it, but right now, I haven't got any

**Books**: A Universe from Nothing, Leviathan Wakes

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: CarX Street (a _really fun_ NFS experience)

**Work**: happily coding ahead, but could work 80h weeks right now with the amount of tasks waiting for me

**Life**: found a _really_ nice apartment, we're trying to upgrade; figuring things out with banks, and planning a move, is consuming a lot of energy; still not sure if the sellers are going to accept our offer, they're a bit weird

**Weight Lifting**: still on 5/3/1, progress has slowed down quite a bit, I'm clawing my way forward; also started doing a push-up challenge, to see how many I'll end up doing in a year
