**Writing**: wish I had time for it, but right now, I haven't got any

**Books**: not much time for that either; when I do find the time to read, it's "A Universe from Nothing", or "Leviathan Wakes"

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: probably less than an hour a week currently; started Dorfromantik, Cocoon, CarX Street, and SW Outlaws not long ago, picking up whatever feels most calming

**Work**: big new project, some old projects, the usual end-of-year busyness - could still work 80h weeks with the amount of tasks waiting for me, and all the private appointments for the apartment stuff aren't helping either

**Life**: sold our lives to the bank and bought that nice apartment; _so much_ to do now, but it'll all be worth it in the end, hopefully

**Weight Lifting**: progress still slow, been sick a bit and skipped some workouts last week, catching up now; did 500+ push-ups in September, mostly in sets of 20, and will keep doing that until I collapse from exhaustion when moving all our furniture
