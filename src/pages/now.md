**Last updated:** Oct. 16th 2024

**Writing**: trying to find more time to write, i.e. finish the [#albums](/tags/albums/) series, and something about cool projects I recently worked on

**Books**: Dune Messiah, Leviathan Wakes

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: Everspace 2, but mostly Diablo II: Resurrected, which I love just like the original all those years ago

**Drinks**: Protein shakes, Milk, almost no alcohol at all

**Work**: building a couple of websites, also preparing for some certifications

**Life**: joined a gym, got back into lifting; autumn's here, so I'm trying to get onto the bike some more before it's too cold for that

Inspired by {% ext "lots of other personal websites", "https://nownownow.com" %} that originally got inspired by Derek Sivers.
