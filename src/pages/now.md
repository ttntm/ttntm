**Writing**: preparing a "7 year website anniversary" post; still want to write that Astro/CMS post that I keep procrastinating

**Books**: Iron Man (Tony Iommi biography), A Universe from Nothing, Leviathan Wakes

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: Star Wars Outlaws

**Work**: back to writing code almost exclusively, feeling good about it

**Life**: the heat is gone, it seems; hardly warm enough for swimming, lots of rain; we didn't use our SUP yet, sadly; playing guitar a lot, got myself a _great_ Yamaha amp, and getting deeper and deeper into playing the blues

**Weight Lifting**: 5/3/1 is working really well for me, progress is good, and it keeps me motivated
