**Writing**: wish I had time for it, but right now, I haven't got any

**Books**: not much time for that either; when I do find the time to read, it's "A Universe from Nothing", or "Leviathan Wakes"

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: still at it with Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader

**Work**: no major news - still on "big new project", which I'm happily focusing on

**Life**: done moving, taking care of the never ending "little things"

**Weight Lifting**: back at the gym since Jan. 12th, started doing Madcow 5x5, and eating like a black hole, to get back what stress and cardio due to moving cost me (in terms of body weight and muscle mass)
