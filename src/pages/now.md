**Writing**: drafting something about my v2 webmention implementantion, and still haven't started that article about Astro and headless CMS options - maybe I'll finally manage to do it this month

**Books**: A Universe from Nothing, Leviathan Wakes

**Articles**: Check my [reading list](/reading/), it gets updated frequently

**Games**: Kingdome Come: Deliverance II

**Work**: doing too much architecture, documentation and other stuff at the moment, not writing a lot of code

**Life**: summer's here, we did our first BBQ, hoping for many more; trying to get more biking done, enjoying my new Ibanez guitar

**Weight Lifting**: finishing a month of arms specialization this week, and got to figure out what to do next
