I'm always curious what hardware and software other people use, so here's my current setup.

**Last updated:** June 16th 2022

## Hardware

I use a Dell Precision M3800 running {% ext "Manjaro", "https://manjaro.org" %} for private stuff and a company owned HP Elitebook 850 G7 running {% ext "Fedora 36", "https://getfedora.org" %} for work. I'm mostly working from home these days, but I don't use an external keyboard or monitor. As far as peripherals are concerned, I use an old SteelSeries Siberia 200 headset and a 4TB Seagate external hard drive. Once in a while I also use a wireless mouse that keeps hanging around at home.

My current phone's a Pixel 4a 5G that I got in 03/2021 when my wife inherited my LG G7 ThinQ after her beloved Sony phone died. The Pixel's a great phone and I got so used to gesture navigation that using other phones feels somehow off now.

## Software

My terminals all use {% ext "Oh My Zsh", "https://ohmyz.sh" %} with {% ext "Powerlevel10k" "https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k" %} and I'm using Code OSS and VS Code with the {% ext "JetBrains Mono", "https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/" %} typeface as my primary editor. I'm currently using the {% ext "Tokyo City", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/huytd/tokyo-city" %} theme, but my all-time favourite theme is {% ext "Plastic", "https://plastictheme.com/themes/vscode" %}. I also use {% ext "Neovim", "https://neovim.io" %} whenever I need to edit files in a terminal.

The **VS Code extensions** I use the most are:

- {% ext "Git History" "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory" %}
- {% ext "Live Preview" "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server" %}
- {% ext "Postcode" "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rohinivsenthil.postcode" %}
- {% ext "Surround" "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yatki.vscode-surround" %}
- {% ext "Template String Converter" "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meganrogge.template-string-converter" %}
- {% ext "Volar" "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar" %}

...there' a bunch of others like "XYZ language support" (PostCSS, TOML, etc.) or {% ext "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss" %} too, but they're not really going to be of much interest to anyone.

I'm using both Firefox Dev. Edition and Edge as browsers currently, but I also used Brave in the past (which I liked a lot actually). All my browsers use {% ext "my custom start page" "https://github.com/ttntm/startpage" %} to have everything important right at my fingertips. I use Firefox as my main browser and my browser extensions are pretty basic:

- {% ext "uBlock Origin" "https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin" %} (all browsers)
- {% ext "Chameleon" "https://github.com/sereneblue/chameleon" %} (Firefox only)
- {% ext "CORS Everywhere" "https://github.com/spenibus/cors-everywhere-firefox-addon" %} (Firefox only)
- {% ext "uMatrix" "https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix" %} (Firefox only)

Other than that, {% ext "Notion", "https://notion.so" %} is what I use for notes, personal task management and writing while {% ext "ProtonMail", "https://protonmail.com" %} takes care of my emails. When I need to edit pixels, I'm using {% ext "GIMP", "https://www.gimp.org" %} or {% ext "Photopea", "https://https://www.photopea.com" %} and when I have to work with vectors, I'm using {% ext "Figma", "https://www.figma.com" %} or {% ext "Inkscape", "https://inkscape.org" %}.

Finally, there's a bunch of smaller yet extremely convenient tools that I use almost every day: {% ext "KeeWeb", "https://keeweb.info" %} for password management, {% ext "aitrack.work", "https://aitrack.work" %} (which I made for myself) for time tracking, {% ext "ProtonVPN", "https://protonvpn.com" %} when I need a VPN and {% ext "Coding.Tools", "https://coding.tools" %} for most other things I need to get done.
