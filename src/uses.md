I'm always curious what hardware and software other people use, so here's my current setup.

**Last updated:** July 19th 2021

## Hardware

I use a Dell Precision M3800 running {% ext "Manjaro", "https://manjaro.org/" %}. I'm mostly working from home these days, but I don't use an external keyboard or monitor. As far as peripherals are concerned, I use an old SteelSeries Siberia 200 headset and a 4TB Seagate external hard drive. Once in a while I also use a wireless mouse that keeps hanging around at home.

My current phone's a Pixel 4a 5G that I got in 03/2021 when my wife inherited my LG G7 ThinQ after her beloved Sony phone died. The Pixel's a great phone and I got so used to gesture navigation that using other phones feels somehow off now.

## Software

My terminal emulator is {% ext "Konsole", "https://konsole.kde.org" %} (theme _Aritim Dark_) with {% ext "Oh My Zsh", "https://ohmyz.sh" %} and I'm using Code OSS (= VS Code) with the {% ext "JetBrains Mono", "https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/" %} typeface as my primary editor. I'm currently using the {% ext "Tokyo Night", "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night" %} theme, but my all-time favourite theme is {% ext "Plastic", "https://plastictheme.com/themes/vscode" %}. I also use {% ext "Neovim", "https://neovim.io" %} whenever I need to edit files directly from the command line.

I'm using both Firefox Dev. Edition and OSS Chromium as browsers currently, but I also used Brave in the past (which I liked a lot actually). I prefer using Firefox, but having Chrom(e/ium) around is somehow necessary when you're a web developer these days - unfortunatley, we've reached a point where certain things only work there.

{% ext "Notion", "https://notion.so" %} is what I use for notes, task management and writing and {% ext "ProtonMail", "https://protonmail.com" %} takes care of my emails. When I need to edit pixels, I'm using {% ext "GIMP", "https://www.gimp.org" %} or {% ext "Photopea", "https://https://www.photopea.com" %} and when I have to work with vectors, I'm using {% ext "Figma", "https://www.figma.com" %} or {% ext "Inkscape", "https://inkscape.org" %}.

Finally, there's a bunch of smaller yet extremely convenient tools that I use almost every day: {% ext "KeeWeb", "https://keeweb.info" %} for password management, {% ext "aitrack.work", "https://aitrack.work" %} (which I made for myself) for time tracking, {% ext "ProtonVPN", "https://protonvpn.com" %} when I need a VPN and {% ext "Coding.Tools", "https://coding.tools" %} for most other things I need to get done.
