## Hardware

I use an immortal Dell Precision M3800 from 2013 running {% ext "Manjaro", "https://manjaro.org" %} for private stuff and a company owned HP Elitebook 850 G7 running {% ext "Fedora 36", "https://getfedora.org" %} for work. I'm mostly working from home these days, but most of the time I don't use an external keyboard or monitor. As far as peripherals are concerned, I use Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 and a 4TB Seagate external hard drive. Once in a while I also use a wireless mouse that keeps hanging around at home.

My current phone's a Pixel 4a 5G that I got in 03/2021 when my wife inherited my LG G7 ThinQ after her beloved Sony phone died. The Pixel's a great phone and I got so used to gesture navigation that using other phones feels somehow off now.

## Software

My terminal emulator is {% ext "WezTerm", "https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/" %} running Zsh with {% ext "Oh My Zsh", "https://ohmyz.sh" %} and {% ext "Powerlevel10k", "https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k" %}. Code OSS (= VS Code) with the {% ext "JetBrains Mono", "https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/" %} typeface is my primary editor. I'm currently using the {% ext "Nord Deep", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/marlosirapuan/nord-deep" %} theme, but my all-time favourite theme is "Plastic" (see below). I also use {% ext "Neovim", "https://neovim.io" %} whenever I need to edit files in a terminal and {% ext "gedit", "https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit" %} as a scratchpad.

The **VS Code extensions** I use the most are:

- {% ext "Git History", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/donjayamanne/githistory" %}
- {% ext "Live Preview", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-vscode/live-server" %}
- {% ext "Surround", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/yatki/vscode-surround" %}
- {% ext "Template String Converter", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/meganrogge/template-string-converter" %}
- {% ext "Volar", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/Vue/volar" %}

...there's a bunch of others like "XYZ language support" (PostCSS, TOML, etc.) or "XYZ IntelliSense" too, but they're not really going to be of much interest to anyone.

**VS Code Theme History**

- {% ext "Tokyo City", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/huytd/tokyo-city" %}
- {% ext "Tokyo Night", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/enkia/tokyo-night" %}
- {% ext "Plastic", "https://plastictheme.com/themes/vscode" %}
- {% ext "Nord", "https://open-vsx.org/extension/arcticicestudio/nord-visual-studio-code" %}

I'm using both Firefox Dev. Edition and Chromium as browsers currently, but I also used Brave in the past (which I liked a lot actually). All my browsers use {% ext "my custom start page", "https://github.com/ttntm/startpage" %} to have everything important right at my fingertips. I use Firefox as my main browser and my extensions are pretty basic:

- {% ext "uBlock Origin", "https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin" %} (all browsers)
- {% ext "Chameleon", "https://github.com/sereneblue/chameleon" %} (Firefox only)
- {% ext "CORS Everywhere", "https://github.com/spenibus/cors-everywhere-firefox-addon" %} (Firefox only)
- {% ext "uMatrix", "https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix" %} (Firefox only)

In addition to that, Firefox uses a minimal 1-line config that I'm often tinkering with. A somewhat stable version of it can be found over at GitHub: {% ext "ttntm/minimal-one-line-firefox" "https://github.com/ttntm/minimal-one-line-firefox" %}

Other than that, {% ext "Notion", "https://notion.so" %} is what I use for notes, personal task management and writing. {% ext "ProtonMail", "https://protonmail.com" %} takes care of my emails. When I need to edit pixels, I'm using {% ext "GIMP", "https://www.gimp.org" %} or {% ext "Photopea", "https://https://www.photopea.com" %} and when I have to work with vectors, I'm using {% ext "Figma", "https://www.figma.com" %} or {% ext "Inkscape", "https://inkscape.org" %}.

Finally, there's a bunch of smaller yet extremely convenient tools that I use almost every day: {% ext "KeeWeb", "https://keeweb.info" %} for password management, {% ext "aitrack.work", "https://aitrack.work" %} for time tracking, {% ext "ProtonVPN", "https://protonvpn.com" %} when I need a VPN and {% ext "Coding.Tools", "https://coding.tools" %} for most other things I need to get done.

## Music

I don't use any music streaming services. It's either local files via {% ext "cmus", "https://cmus.github.io" %} (my own CD/Vinyl rips collected over the years) or actual records played on my Audio Technica AT-LP120XBT-USB. The turntable's Bluetooth connection is super convenient: it lets me listen to music my wife would get a headache from without disturbing her at all.
