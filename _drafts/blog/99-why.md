# Why Am I Doing This?

aka Blog Questions Challenge

via: https://leilukin.com/blog/posts/2025-01-07-blog-questions-challenge/

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?
## What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why did you choose it?
## Have you blogged on other platforms before?
## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?
## When do you feel most inspired to write?
## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?
## What's your favorite post on your blog?
## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?
