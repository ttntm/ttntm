A chronological list of my favorite albums from 2010 to 2019 with reasons why I like them.

As of late 2024, this is the final post in the [#albums](/tags/albums/) series.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/c-cc2.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Crystal Castles - Crystal Castles (II)", "Release: 2010" %}

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/ng-ng.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "NiT GriT - NiT GriT", "Release: 2010" %}

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/m-whtn.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Mgła - With Hearts Toward None", "Release: 2012" %}

An absolute masterpiece, and definitely among the best Black Metal albums I know. It's a fierce, dark record that's evil to the bone. It's also showcasing Mgła's mastery of musical craftsmanship - both composition and delivery of the tracks on this record are outstanding.

The final track, VII, has a very special place in my heart; it's left a mark so deep, that the mere thought of it sends a shiver down my spine -- "Always downwards - and toward the farthest sides of the north!"

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/b-c.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Beastmilk - Climax", "Release: 2013" %}

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/md-h.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Mega Drive - Hardwired", "Release: 2013" %}

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/dc-potf.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Dead Congregation - Promulgation of the Fall", "Release: 2014" %}

An outstanding Death Metal record that shows how Dead Congregation are among the masters of the genre. It's a worthy successor to their debut that delivers dark and brutally obscure tracks that could be compared to bands like Deicide, Immolation, or Incantation.

{% imageHeader "/img/albums/d-sc.jpg", imageHeaderSize, "h3", "Domains - Sinister Ceremonies", "Release: 2014" %}

Got to know about this album randomly, saw it mentioned a newsletter, I think, and decided to give it a try. And hell, that was a good decision! "Sinister Ceremonies" is one of the best Death Metal albums of this decade, without a doubt, and probably among the best ever. It's a razor sharp record, full of dark, occult energy, backed by a surprisingly refined production that leaves a very professional impression.
