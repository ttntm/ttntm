(The Joy of) Making Your Own Tools

Growing up with computers and the internet, my idea of a "tool" became equivalent to software at a rather early age. Actual tools, in terms of hammers, power tools or screwdrivers, certainly existed in our household and were also interesting enough for me to learn how to use them at some point. However, none of that came quite close to how it felt to build my first website or to set up a brand-new wireless home network.

Many years later, the sentiment of "tool equals software" is still deeply embedded in my subconscious. I'm ok paying 100+€/year for a software subscription, but I'm somehow struggling to justify the purchase of a torque wrench (a ~120€ one-time payment) to myself. I'd only need that torque wrench maybe 5 times per year, but that's not really an excuse either, considering that it's probably a once-in-a-lifetime purchase.

Aside from making physical tool purchases a bit harder, my "tool equals software" mindset has contributed to the fact that I'd usually prefer to make my own tools whenever that made sense (sometimes also when it didn't, but that's another story). I'd also choose hand-coding websites into editors without syntax highlighting, while people across the room were cursing at Dreamweaver, and I built lightweight CMS systems from scratch, instead of installing another WordPress instance that'd get hacked at some point anyway.

Over time, most of the tools I built for myself, and others, eventually died or were replaced with other tools that did things better, but sometimes also worse. However, some of the tools I built stood the test of time, and even saw new features, updates and fixes. Let's have a look at some of them now.

If we ignore this website for a moment (more on that later), my oldest actively maintained "make your own" tool is **recept0r**. It's a lightweight web application that me and my wife use to keep track of recipes we like.
