Collections and lists are a wonderful thing, and filters simply make them better. The first use case was my whisky collection, and I've also created an [/albums](/albums/) page in the meantime. Both lists are filterable by different criteria, and use the same code for it.

So, let's have a look at how one could build such a composable filter for Eleventy collections.

## Prerequisites

A collection, does not matter if JSON from `_data` or markdown from `config.addCollection()`

### Rendering the Collection

Wrapper `<ul>` in parent, for even better reusability

## The Filter UI

This section expands on a note I wrote back in March: [11ty: passing collections to shortcodes](/notes/#33).

## Composable Logic

### Setup and Configuration

Mix with other code

Wrap in event listener

Configuration object

## Summary

Not tested: multiple instances of the filter on the same page - could work, but would need some changes in the config and how it is handled
